In my ongoing quest to make delicious alcoholic beverages, I have increasingly
found myself digging into my ingredients.  Syrups, as a class of ingredient,
have received a decent amount of my attention.  As an aside, if you're buying
simple syrup, you are doing a lot of things wrong.  In my experience, it is
decidedly tricky to find decent grenadine, where decent is defined as being
made with real pomegranate and without high fructose corn syrup or food
coloring.  So, I've started to make my own:

Grenadine
---------

A pomegranate syrup that adds a sweet tartness to drinks and a distinctive
red color.  Notable in small quantities in a great many drinks and also as
the second ingredient in a Shirley Temple, a drink the actress was apparently
never fond of.

Ingredients
~~~~~~~~~~~

-   1 cup fresh Pomegranate Juice (~2 large pomegranates)
-   1 oz Pomegranate Molasses
-   1 1/2 cup White Sugar
-   1/16 tsp Xanthan Gum (optional)
-   1/2 tsp Orange Blossom Water
-   1 oz over-proof grain neutral spirit (Everclear or vodka)

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

#.  Juice your pomegranates and run the juice through a strainer to remove
    the seeds and larger pulp.  I find an electric citrus reamer works quite
    well for juicing a pomegranate.
#.  Mix the sugar with the Xanthan Gum.  Xanthan gum is tricky to work with
    and tends to clump or form gelatinous regions; I find it easiest if the
    Xanthan Gum is spread out in the sugar before adding to the liquid.
#.  Heat pomegranate juice in a saucepan over medium heat.
#.  Slowly whisk in the sugar/Xanthan Gum mixture.
#.  Add pomegranate molasses.
#.  Continue whisking, turning down heat if necessary to avoid boiling
#.  When all of the sugar is dissolved, turn off the heat.
#.  Add orange blossom water.
#.  Add grain neutral spirit
#.  Whisk until fully combined.
#.  Decant into a bottle for storage.


Notes
~~~~~

-   Not all pomegranate molasses is created equal.  It took me a few tries
    before I found a brand that I like.  Most recently, I'm using Carlo brand
    pomegranate molasses.  In my experience Cortas (most commonly available)
    is a little too heterogeneous, dark, and tart, which results in a
    grenadine that falls short on color and visual consistency.
-   Store bought pomegranate juice can be substituted for fresh squeezed juice
    but will produce an inferior result.  I have used POM 100% pomegranate
    juice (from concentrate) and it's fairly ok; better than store bought
    grenadine but still a sad shadow of using fresh pomegranate juice.
-   1 oz is probably too much Everclear for ~12-16oz of syrup but I tend to
    go through grenadine slow enough that I prefer that it keeps well and
    the flavor is largely unnoticeable behind the grenadine.  In California,
    Everclear is 151 proof so you may want to decrease your ratios is you're
    able to but Everclear at 190 proof.

... and because it'd be poor form to give you an ingredient without a
drink ...

Jack Rose
---------

I feel the Jack Rose is a perfect drink to show off grenadine (it's also
perfect to show off an apple brandy).  The grenadine and the Applejack
emphasis without altering each others flavors and, if the ratios are right,
it's possible to taste each component individually within the drink without
finding the drink overly discordant.


Ingredients
~~~~~~~~~~~

-   3/4 oz Grenadine
-   3/4 oz Lime Juice
-   2 oz Applejack


Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

#.  Shake ingredients with ice.
#.  Serve in a single rocks glass.
#.  Garnish with a maraschino cherry and a thin apple slice.


Notes
~~~~~

-   Following David Wondrich's lead from `Imbibe`_, I've gone with lime juice
    over lemon juice.  I think it makes for a more balanced, well-rounded
    drink.
-   There are plenty of apple brandy options out there.  For a Jack Rose, I
    recommend using something in the drier, American Applejack style; Calvados
    is delicious (and often better than Applejack) but it's not right for
    this drink.

    -   I've been particularly enjoying Arkansas Black Straight Applejack and
        recommend it over the other things that I've tried.
    -   Laird's makes entirely decent applejack but they also make some
        entirely mediocre apple brandies.  Laird's 100 proof Straight Apple
        Brandy is a good option.  Looking to other contexts, the Laird's
        Straight Apple Brandy is great for drying out otherwise sweet drinks
        or balancing the sweeter Calvados style of apple brandy.
