I have a 14 month old daughter, a wife that likes yogurt with granola, and I
kind of like the stuff too. Needless to say, we go through a lot of yogurt in
my house. Specifically, we go through a lot of plain, whole milk, Greek yogurt.

We were recently visiting my wife's aunt and uncle (my daughter's graunt and
gruncle), and we had yogurt most mornings. They use an
`EasiYo <https://www.easiyo.com/>`_ to make their yogurt, which piqued my
curiosity.

Fancy yogurt is pretty expensive at the store, upwards of $7 or $8 per 32oz
container. Yogurt is just fermented milk and I've fermented plenty of things
before. I should be able to make yogurt, right?

So, how about `EasiYo`_? Turns out it's not that much cheaper.

We can do better, let's `ask the Internet <https://www.google.com/search?q=slowcooker+greek+yogurt>`__.

Turns out it's pretty straightforward; I just finished our second batch
yesterday. It also turns out to be really good, and it's less than $2 per
32oz (milk choice depending).

Slowcooker Greek Yogurt recipe
------------------------------

* 1 gallon whole milk
* ½ to 1 cup starter plain (not-Greek) yogurt

1. Pour the full gallon of milk into the slowcooker.
2. Set the slowcooker to high for 2.5 hours.
3. When the slowcooker beeps, check the milk.

   a. Use a thermometer to check the temperature, we want it to be 180°F
   b. We want the milk to be scalded so that some of the proteins start to
      denature.
   c. The milk should be starting to thicken at the surface or develop a
      skin
   d. If the milk hasn't hit 180°F, give it another 30 minutes at high.

4. Turn off and unplug the slowcooker
5. Wait 3 hours.

   a. Use a thermometer to check the temperature, we want it to be 110°F
      (plus or minus about 5°F).
   b. If the temperature is too high, wait longer.
   c. If the temperature is too low, reconnect the slowcooker, set it to low,
      and give it a little while.

6. Put your starter yogurt in a small bowl, and add about a cup of the warm
   milk. Mix it up pretty thoroughly to warm/revive the cultures, and break
   up the thickness of the starter yogurt.
7. Pour your starter+milk mix into the slowcooker and stir in slow, back and
   forth motions. We want turbulence for mixing, so we do back and forth
   stirring to avoid `Laminar Flow <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar_flow>`__,
   which can happen with circular stirring. Also, circular stirring is a
   little more likely to spill over the edges.
8. Cover the slowcooker (and lid) with a towel to keep heat in.
9. Let everything sit undisturbed for 6-8 hours.
10. Scoop out a cup of the yogurt and set it aside so it can be a starter for
    your next batch.

11. Set a colander in a bowl, with cheesecloth in the colander, and start
    scooping the yogurt into the colander.
12. Whey will drip through into your catch bowl, and the yogurt will thicken
    in the cheesecloth.
13. Once all the yogurt is in the cheesecloth (you might have to wait for it
    to settle a bit before adding more), and you've waited a couple hours,
    you'll have nice thick yogurt in your cheesecloth, and fresh whey in your
    bowl.
14. Jar the yogurt, bottle the whey.
15. Done.

One gallon milk, yields about 10 cups (2.5 32oz mason jars) yogurt and a bit over a
quart of whey.
