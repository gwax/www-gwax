Kind of makes me wonder whether there is a general principle involved. Taking regular polygons with side length 1 and centering circles at the corners and asking about the various figures that can be drawn. EG an equilateral triangle, using circles of radius :math:`\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}`. Or pentagons, using circles of radius 1; or etc. How come some of them are solvable and not others? I don't even know how to find the area of a pentagon.
