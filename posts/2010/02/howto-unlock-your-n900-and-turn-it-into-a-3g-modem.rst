After reading the recent `Boing Boing <http://www.boingboing.net/>`__
post about `HOWTO unlock your Nexus One and turn it into a 3G
modem <http://www.boingboing.net/2010/02/23/howto-unlock-your-ne.html>`__,
I thought it might be worth putting together a similar set of
instructions for the Nokia N900.

Some notes before we begin:

#.  This is a supported use of your phone.
#.  There is no risk of bricking your phone.
#.  This does not wipe your phone.
#.  You don't need to back anything up before starting.

Install Bluetooth Dial-Up Networking support
--------------------------------------------

#.  Open the Application Manager
#.  Install the "Bluetooth Dial-Up Networking" Application

Tether your computer
--------------------

-   `Windows <http://lmgtfy.com/?q=bluetooth+tether+windows>`__
-   `Ubuntu <http://lmgtfy.com/?q=bluetooth+tether+ubuntu>`__
-   `etc. <http://www.google.com/>`__
