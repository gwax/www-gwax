A couple months ago, I bought a pair of `Vibram
FiveFingers <http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/>`__ shoes, specifically a
pair of
`KSO <http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/products_KSO_m.cfm>`__\ s.
I've been wearing the shoes pretty regularly and, to be entirely honest,
they are probably the most comfortable shoes that I have ever worn. The
shoes don't provide support in the way typical shoes do so it takes some
getting used to and rebuilding strength in muscles that have been
under-utilized since childhood. Once your feet get used to the
FiveFingers, it becomes a truly fantastic experience to rediscover
walking, jogging, sprinting, and the like.

Additionally, recent research shows that `barefoot running is low
impact <http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100127134241.htm>`__
in a way that shod running is not. Apparently, running barefoot changes
your gait, which I can anecdotally confirm.

Worth noting, in the negatives column, you cannot wear traditional socks
with FiveFingers and they will start to smell if you wear them regularly
without socks. FiveFingers shoes are machine washable, which is an
option, or one can purchase toe socks from
`Injini <http://www.injinji.com/>`__ (or others), which is the solution
that I've chosen. Sadly, the toe socks solution is somewhat expensive
but, for me, I'm sufficiently hooked on my FiveFingers that it's worth
it to me.
