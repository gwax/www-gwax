I guess that we've finished a decade and moved into a new one. On
account of predictions are fun, I'll give you a few that are all but
guaranteed to come true in the following decade:

-   We'll all get personal jetpacks.
-   Hoverboards will make it to market.
-   Everyone will start driving flying cars.
-   Jesus Christ will return to us.
-   Skynet will be born.
-   We will reach the singularity.

This is just a few of the wonderful things that are going to happen
within the next decade; I'm really looking forward to all the fun.

Happy new decade!
