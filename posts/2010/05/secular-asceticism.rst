I am not a religious man but I have found, at times, that periods of
abstinence/asceticism can be good for one's body and spirit. Of course,
as with any abstinence regimen, what one is abstaining from and the
reasons for the undertaking play a very large part in what one can get
out of it.

This month marks the second time that I have undertaken a month of
asceticism; the first having been March of 2009. Last time, I took a
`straight edge <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_Edge>`__ approach,
abstaining from caffeine, alcohol, and all other psychoactive
substances. This year, I am repeating the same abstention of caffeine,
alcohol, and drugs but adding high-fructose corn syrup.

As I mentioned, I feel that the what and why of any ascetic regimen
plays a large part in what one gets from the experience. My first bout
of asceticism, last year, was prompted by the feeling that my caffeine
consumption had reached unreasonable levels and, if the degree of
caffeine withdrawal that I went through at that time was any indication,
I was correct in my feeling. At the time, I decided that if I was going
to go off caffeine for a month, cold-turkey, I might as well do the same
with any other mind-altering substance. This time, my reasoning is
largely derived from the feeling of homeostasis obtained during my last
run of asceticism. I am adding high-fructose corn syrup this time around
because I am under the (marginally scientific) impression that
high-fructose corn syrup is unhealthy to consume and do not normally
maintain any level of awareness over its consumption.

As we're nearing the end of my first week of abstention, I can report on
some of the specifics of the experience thus far:

-   Caffeine - Oh, how I miss caffeine; I am an addict and I crave my
    fix. Actually, as of today, I find myself craving caffeine far less
    than I did even yesterday. Thankfully, this year, my caffeine
    consumption was far lower before the undertaking than last year. Last
    time, I had monstrously intense migraines for nearly a week due to
    caffeine withdrawal; this time, I had moderate migraines on day two
    (Sunday) but the major symptoms had cleared by day three (Monday).
    Cravings, as I mentioned, are subsiding and I hope to be back to
    baseline sometime next week.
-   Alcohol - Abstaining from alcohol is mostly a social nuisance for me.
    I usually drink socially, as is the case with a great many, if not
    all, of my friends. On its own giving up alcohol isn't a huge deal
    but, when one's abstention from caffeine and high-fructose corn syrup
    means that you can't even have "just a Coke," things get annoying.
    Abstaining from alcohol also makes me aware of the frequency with
    which I will go to the fridge for something to drink and grab a beer;
    this has largely been replaced by grabbing a glass of milk or
    Ovaltine (thankfully free of high-fructose corn syrup).
-   Drugs - Not really a substantive change, mostly here to round out the
    list and allow the classification to be simplified to *psychoactive
    substances and high-fructose corn syrup* for discussion purposes.
-   High fructose corn-syrup - Fuck! This shit is in everything!
    High-fructose corn syrup is really hard to avoid; I'm sure that I'm
    missing things that contain this stuff. I went into a gas station
    mart on Saturday to get a beverage and the only things that I could
    find without caffeine or high-fructose corn syrup were water, milk,
    and Diet Sprite. I didn't put ketchup on my french fries at lunch
    today because ketchup contains high-fructose corn syrup. For Christ's
    sake, they even put high-fructose corn syrup in Saltine's. The
    addition of high-fructose corn syrup to my abstention list is both
    maddening and somewhat enlightening.

That's where we're at for now; I'll keep you posted as the month goes
on.
