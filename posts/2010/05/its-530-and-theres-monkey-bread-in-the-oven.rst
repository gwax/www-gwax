Sometime round abouts 3, I found myself in the living room, bored, and
with my laptop. One thing led to another, and there was
`Google <http://www.google.com/>`__, font of random knowledge. Typing
random word combinations into Google, I discovered (much as ol'
Christopher Columbus did the new world) that there is a foodstuff by the
name of monkey bread.

Being the me that I happen to be, specifically, the me that you likely
know to be me, I could not help but attempt to construct this amazingly
named baked good. Googling about the Internets, I decided upon `a recipe
from The Pioneer Woman
Cooks <http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2009/05/monkey-bread/>`__ due
to a combination of general recipe consensus and a fondness for the tone
of the author's writing.

Having chosen a recipe and (mostly) followed it, here I sit, typing
while I wait on the oven. The monkey bread, which I cannot imagine being
anything less than `4 Billion % <http://probertson.livejournal.com/23973.html?page=5>`__
(`YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNMJe83VxdY>`__) awesome, will
be done cooking around 6. I'll probably wait around until the monkey
bread is ready to remove from its cake mold womb, pop it out, and leave
it for my various roommates to discover come tomorrow.

Tasting reports may, perhaps, follow, though given my posting track
record, I would not hold out high hopes.
