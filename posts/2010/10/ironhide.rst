Some number of weeks ago, having discovered `Maraschino
liqueur <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maraschino>`__, I concocted a
variation on my beloved
`Manhattan <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_%28cocktail%29>`__. I
have been meaning to write up the recipe here for a while but had been
stuck on coming up with a name; I needed a name befitting a strong
whiskey cocktail with connections to myself and the color red. Having
thought for quite a while and come up with a bunch of names that were
already taken by other cocktails, I settled on naming the drink after
the grizzled, old Autobot,
`Ironhide <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironhide>`__. So, without
further ado:

Ironhide recipe
---------------

-   3 oz Bourbon whiskey
-   3/4 oz Maraschino
-   1/4 oz grenadine
-   2 dashes Angostura bitters
-   1 Maraschino cherry

Serve shaken or stirred with ice in a cocktail glass; garnish with the
Maraschino cherry.

Notes
-----

I have mostly been drinking these on the rocks, which is an acceptable
but inferior variation. Being a Manhattan-like cocktail, up-high is
really the correct way to serve an Ironhide.

Corn syrup based grenadine or "maraschino" cherries will ruin the
flavors imparted by the bitters and Maraschino; you will make a better
cocktail by skipping the grenadine and cherry than using cheap, fake
ones.
