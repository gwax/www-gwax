I have been thinking about the following quote a fair bit recently:

    Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds
    discuss people.

    -- variously attributed to Eleanor Roosevelt, Hyman G. Rickover, or
    anonymously

Since having come across the quote, I have found myself grouping social
interactions by whether the discussions are primarily of ideas, events,
or people. Near invariably, I have found the interactions involving
discussions of ideas are stimulating, interesting, and enjoyable;
whereas, similarly, discussions of people--in the absence of
sociological/anthropological/psychological analysis, which blurs the
line between people and ideas--tend to feel hollow and vapid.

At present, I have really only gotten to the point of noticing the
connections, and frequently only so noticing in retrospect. I have not,
as yet, found a practical application for this knowledge.

Practical, or not, I do feel that it is fantastically interesting to
seek correlations between my enjoyment of interactions and the
underlying class/topic of discussion.
