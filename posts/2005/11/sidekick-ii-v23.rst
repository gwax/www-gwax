Earlier today, my Sidekick notified me of a new over-the-air update; now
seeing as it will keep pestering you until you update and I'm the "ooh
new and flash!" sort of person, I let it go and install the update. I've
only been poking at the thing a little bit, but I can already say that
v2.3 is definitely a good update, in more than just superficial ways. A
lot of little things have changed and some biggish things have changed.
I expect there's some stuff I haven't seen yet and so far everything's
good. Here's a quick run-down of some of the changes I've seen:

-  AOL Instant Messenger - Added buddy icon support. Away messages now
   appear on buddy list. Still no profile support.
-  Phone - Icon has changed; first and least impressive thing I've
   noticed.
-  Address Book - Added Instant Messaging field, which pleases me
   immensely and means I'll have to spend some time with my address book
   in the near future.
-  Web Browser - Here's where v2.3 really shines and gave me a couple of
   "Holy shit!" moments. The interface and notifications are a little
   cleaner and more informative, ok. There is now a *Find* feature,
   keen. Much better CSS support, woah good! JavaScript support, SWEET
   MOTHER OF MERCY! I haven't had much of a chance to look into the
   JavaScript support yet, but I'm going to fire up
   `digg <http://digg.com/>`__ and `Google
   Maps <http://maps.google.com/>`__ later to test the quality of
   things. This may mean that I'll have to modify the CSS on my website
   and blog to accommodate a functional browser with a 240x160 screen.
-  Camera - New loading screen instead of just freezing up for a few
   moments with the word loading overlaid, reassuring and good
   improvement. Better picture quality, maybe, I'm not sure but it seems
   to be taking slightly better photos, if it's a placebo, oh well, if
   it's real, HOT!

That's all that I've noticed so far and I'm very pleased. I'll update
after I check the JavaScript and if I find anything more.
