I have decided to start using a new rating system for ascribing quality
and victory to things and people, namely pants. For example, I am going
to award two and a half pants to the person that suggested I watch the
movie that I'm watching right now. It should be noted that this is pants
and not pairs of pants.

The pants I am discussing here are less like real pants and more like
points, in a karmic sense. To that end, they are non-transferable, have
no monetary value, are non-corporeal and are not keep in any records.
