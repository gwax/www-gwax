I just finished watching the last of the Transformers cartoons (all of
the first series) and I think that I can easily say that the show
started good, got better and better, peaked after Season 2 with
Transformers: The Movie and then went downhill slowly through Season 3
and ending in mediocrity with the Rebirth mini-series (aka. Season 4).
Seasons 3 and 4 suffered from an excess of commercialization in that the
show seemed to be pushing half a dozen new toys every few episodes. The
same commercialization could be seen in the first 2 seasons but was done
with more sublety and background.

My complaints about Seasons 3 and 4 aside, I still found the overall
experience quite enjoyable and recommend it for the die hard fans.
Watching it in full instead of random episodes here and there when I was
too young to keep them stored in my head gives a fantastic perspective
on the whole storyline and the characters themselves. Of course, the
full perspective also gives me a real appreciation for the shear
quantity of gaping holes in the storyline and crazy faux technical
lingo. It makes me wonder if it wouldn't be possible to convince someone
to fund a complete remake of the original series; rewrite all of the old
stories, cut a few, add a few, create overall continuity and then
outsource the animation to some Korean studio that'll get whipped by
some guy until bear drives in and Tom Cruise saves the day.
