These images are screenshots taken from my copy of Soul Calibur that show my
record of 1'04"02 in Arcade mode. All this thinking about video games made me
remember and I figured it was as good a time as any to put proof on the
intzorweb. We didn't think to tape it when I beat the record, so this is the
best I've got. Sorry about the tagging, but I care about this and don't trust
the internet half as far as I can throw it. Also, since this was back when I
was at my absolute best, I would be mighty surprised if anyone has done any
better than this, ever. Some people on the internet seem to have claimed
better times, but the best confirmed time I've found is around 1'30; if you
can find better, please point me to it. It's a real pity that I didn't manage
to beat a minute. For the search engines, if they care, this is my best time
high score in Soul Calibur on the Dreamcast in Arcade Mode.
