It turns out there exists a reason not to hate the DOA series of
fighting games, other than the high quality female chest rendering
effects that make the 16 year olds oggle. You might be asking, what
possible reason might a die hard Soul Calibur aficionado, like myself,
have to like DOA? Well, it turns out that Tecmo's pulled a franchising
fast one on me and included master ninja Ryu Hayabusa of Ninja Gaiden
fame in their DOA games. The problem here, of course, is that I didn't
want a reason to like DOA, I was plenty content considering it a crappy
fighting game. Now I'm going to have to go and find myself a copy of
DOA2 for the Dreamcast, reevaluate my opinion on the matter as regards
Ryu Hayabusa and then I'm going to have to think about this later when
DOA4 comes out. Incidentally, the proposed cover art for DOA4
`prominently <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Doa4cover.jpg>`__
displays Ryu (back row, second from the left) in full ninja get-up. Damn
you for finding my weakness Tecmo, damn you!

*UPDATE:*\ DAMN IT! DAMN IT! DAMN IT! DOA4 is also going to include a
Halo Spartan, namely the female Spartan-458 (Master Chief is
Spartan-117). They really have found my weakness, commercialization of
fighting games. MVC, Smash Brothers, and now DOA, these fighting game
makers are clever.
