In my continued policy of watching a whole bunch of movies ranging from
very good to highly dubious in quality, I just watched Tremors 2, 3
and 4, having seen the first many years ago. I can easily say that the
first one was fun as far as bad horror movies go. Notably though, the
first one had Kevin Bacon in it. The second and third ones followed the
trend of horror movie sequels being worse than the original, but still
fun in a campy kind of way, sort of. The fourth in the series, goes and
completely redeems the second and third by being set in the Wild West
and having Billy Drago, of The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. fame.
Things don't get much better than a Western with giant killer sand worms
that doesn't take itself seriously.
