In continuing with being unemployed, I went and participated in a focus
group at Verizon Labs in Waltham and made $75 today. I got into the
focus group through a posting on
`Craigslist <http://boston.craigslist.org/>`__ and by filling out a
survey about my video game usage. In my world of right now, the whole
endeavor worked out to talking about video games for an hour and a half
in exchange for a full tank of gas and an extra $40; this unemployed
thing is kind of annoying but it does have it's more romantic elements.

Anyway, you might be wondering what Verizon cares about video games for,
which is something that I wondered as well. Verizon is working on
launching their FiOS fiber optic broadband service and is trying to
figure out different service packages to include with the thing and
they're thinking of including a video game service. Thankfully, they
seem aware of the fact that they have no chance of competing with the
likes of Microsoft, Sony or Nintendo and seem to be looking into making
a service based on older games and simpler games. Personally, I think
that it's a retarded idea that's going to fail miserably because the
only people that want to play older games already do so with old
consoles or with emulators. So that's what they're planning and if they
wanted to, they could pay me $100k and I'd write up a great big document
explaining why it's a bad idea that's destined to fail but they only
gave me $75 so I gave my input as was appropriate to the situation and
they'll probably go through with it anyway. I expect that they've
already invested upwards of a million dollars in this and won't want to
cut the cord, which will end up losing them many millions more in the
end. I'm telling you Verizon, pay me more and I'll spell out for any
executive you have, even those that don't know a thing about video
games, why this is a horrible idea that's destined to lose you money.
I'm no businessman but I'm savvy to the mind of the video game player
and I'm plenty savvy to the way my generation buys crap.
