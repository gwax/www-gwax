In my free time, I've been playing with the wonderful
`Uncyclopedia <http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Main_Page>`__ a whole bunch.
For those poor souls out there that don't know about Uncyclopedia, it's
basically `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page>`__ but
wrong; that and it's the twelfth wonder of the world. I've contributed a
lot to a few articles and a bit to a lot of articles.

Some articles which I've contributed heavily to include (but are not
limited to):

-  `Optimus Prime <http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Transformers#Optimus_Prime>`__
-  `Igpay Atinlay <http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Igpay_Atinlay>`__
-  `Grue <http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Grue>`__

And a couple of articles that I really like but haven't contributed
much, if any, to:

-  `Kitten Huffing <http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Kitten_Huffing>`__
-  `AAAAAAAAA! <http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/AAAAAAAAA%21>`__
-  `The GI Joe-Transformers
   War <http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/The_GI_Joe-Transformers_War>`__
-  `The Oldest Trick in the
   Book <http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/The_Oldest_Trick_in_the_Book>`__
-  `World War I (video
   game) <http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_%28video_game%29>`__

In conclusion, Uncyclopedia is awesome and everyone should use it more
and contribute to it a bunch.
