There's a wonderful form of art known as Rock Balancing Art, where you,
simply, balance rocks on top of each other. It may seem simple but some
people have done some rather fantastic things with regards to balancing
rocks. One such example is a short film called
`Balancing Point <http://www.rock-on-rock-on.com/others-balancing-point.html>`__
(`watch online <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YS--NlvNXM>`__), where some
guy theatrically knocked down balanced rocks and then reversed the film; the
effect is rather uncanny.
