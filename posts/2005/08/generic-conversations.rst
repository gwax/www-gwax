I've been playing a wonderful conversational game of late, having
generic conversations. The game works a little like this, instead of
having an actual conversation, you express the generic underlying
conversation or make vague, general statements. It's a little hard to
grasp from that description, so here's an example.

A: Statement of inquiry.

B: Acknowledgment of inquiry. Vague half-answer meant to divert topic.

A: Statement drawing focus to diversion but accepting it and changing
topic.

C: Bold statement regarding new topic meant to draw attention to self.

B: Veiled statement of distaste for forceful interjection. Empty
statement to lighten conversation.

A: Witty banter.

C: Short joke that's not very good.

A: Really terribly joke.

B: Statement about a current event.

etcetera

Of course, this is a poor example because I had to come up with it on my
own to illustrate a point. Certainly though, one can use varying levels
of vagueness and generality. It's a great deal of fun and can be rather
challenging to keep things generic but interesting without repeating
oneself or devolving into meaninglessness.
