I went to see the orthopedic surgeon again today for a follow up look at
my shoulder and he took some X-Rays and it turns out that I chipped my
scapula. This means that my glenoid labrum is probably torn; the glenoid
labrum is the soft tissue that extends from the scapula to make a soft
cup sort of thing for the joint. The chipped piece of scapula will have
either torn itself entirely free or is still connected to the glenoid
labrum. If the chip is connected to the glenoid labrum it will prevent
proper healing and I will need surgery; if it has floated free it can
probably be ignored and the glenoid labrum should hopefully be able to
heal itself with time. In order to find out how the status of my soft
tissue I'm going to have to get an MRI sometime next week and then make
another follow up appointment.

The future of my shoulder recovery is now dependent on the MRI results.
If the chip has dragged the glenoid along with it, I'll get surgery,
which will be followed by 6 weeks of immobilization and recovery and
then 3 months of physical therapy. However, if I'm lucky, the problem
can be ignored and I can start physical therapy soon and have a working
arm again in a month or so.

Since optimism has been building me up for big let downs of late, I
think that I'll just go with the pessimist approach and work on
accepting that I'm going to have to get surgery and have a bum shoulder
for the next 5 months. It's almost as though I couldn't just let myself
be happy and have a good summer, so I added a sour vein through the
summer. I guess that I'll just tack this up as another example of the
way my luck runs.
