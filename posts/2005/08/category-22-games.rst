`SonicWALL Internet Security <http://www.sonicwall.com/>`__ offers
content filtering services and via their website, you can
`look up the rating <http://cfssupport.sonicwall.com/Support/web/eng/newui/viewRating.jsp>`__
of a website. Apparently, my blog is rated "Category 22 - Games", while
`my homepage <http://www.gwax.com/>`__ is "Category 64 - Unrated". I guess
that means that I run a gaming blog; fancy that.
