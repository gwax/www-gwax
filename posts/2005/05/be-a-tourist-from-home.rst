The Internet continues to provide in new and fascinating ways. Already,
the Internet has made it possible to interact with other human beings,
get new movies, order food and so much more without leaving home.
However, it has not been possible to travel to far off places and see
what there is to see; that has changed. With the advent of `Google
Maps <http://maps.google.com/>`__
(`Satellite <http://maps.google.com/maps?spn=82.968750,114.960938&t=k&hl=en>`__)
it became possible to see far off places and take up `Google
Sightseeing <http://www.googlesightseeing.com/>`__.

For a few nice sights to start with, try:
`Bermuda <http://www.googlesightseeing.com/2005/04/22/87/>`__ (check the
"wave-radiating aperture"), `Forest
Fires <http://www.googlesightseeing.com/2005/04/25/forest-fire-mega-post/>`__,
`Hernando Desoto
Bridge <http://www.googlesightseeing.com/2005/05/20/hernando-desoto-bridge/>`__
(check the shadow), `Cape
Canaveral <http://www.googlesightseeing.com/2005/04/07/cape-canaveral/>`__,
`Some Pretty Spot in
Montana <http://www.googlesightseeing.com/2005/05/13/mars/>`__, `Crop
Field Pixel
Art <http://www.googlesightseeing.com/2005/04/19/pixel-fields/>`__,
`Weird Nevada
Triangle <http://www.googlesightseeing.com/2005/04/13/trippy-triangle/>`__
and many more.
