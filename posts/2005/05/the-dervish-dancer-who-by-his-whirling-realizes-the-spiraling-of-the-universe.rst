I went to see a performance by some whirling dervishes with Taylor
today. The performance was quite something and the music was absolutely
spectacular. The affair certainly satisfied by curiosity and
expectations as to the nature of dervishes. Low quality photos on moblog
in a few moments.

Ok, just to let you know what whirling dervishes are, they are a Turkish
sect of Islam that practices whirling meditation. Whirling meditation
is, rather like it sounds, a meditation where the practitioner spins in
a circle until they are so overwhelmed that they enter a gnostic state,
often collapsing. In performance, the dervishes do not go fully to
collapse, but they are still quite impressive.

P.S. The post title is stolen from the Vangelis song Dervish D (Inspired

Universe).
