So I've been futzing with my server a bunch today (because I don't want
to write papers) and I've accomplished a few things. I've got a
mailserver working (that's new for me). I've got my administration pages
protected by SSL (also new). That's the server work side of things.

On another front, I've decided to deprecate `gwax's
sitings <http://photos.gwax.com>`__ in favor of `gwax's
wanderings <http://moblog.gwax.com>`__. This is because I want somewhere
that I can shove photos from my phone and I want it to have an e-mail
based posting system. I will allow comments as soon as I can figure out
a good way to prevent comment spam (which I expect will involve my
modifying the WordPress bot-check plugin to work in EasyMoblog).
