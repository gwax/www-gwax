As one of the last things that I have to do this week (in order to
graduate), I have to write a 15+ page paper on the subject of Inorganic
and Organometallic Polyers. I know enough about Inorganic and
Organometallic Polymers to fill, at most, two or three pages. The only
time that I'm going to have to write this paper is the next 28 hours. So
as to be able to accomplish this task, I have obtained the following
requisite supplies:

-  1x Ray, N. H. - Inorganic Polymers
-  1x Mark, James E.; et al. - Inorganic Polymers
-  1x Archer, Ronald D. - Inorganic and Organometallic Polymers
-  1x 2 liter bottle Mountain Dew
-  1x 23.5 fluid ounce can Jolt Cola
-  1x 23.5 fluid ounce can Jolt Blue
-  4x 6.5 ounce Shur Fine Sausage Pizza
-  1x 17 ounce box Cracklin' Oat Bran
-  1x 18 ounce container Duncan Hines Whipped Vanilla Frosting
-  1x 1 gallon bottle Hood 2% Milk
