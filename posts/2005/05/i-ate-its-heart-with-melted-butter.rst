At home a while back I was talked into eating an artichoke and I
actually happened to like the thing. Since then I hadn't eaten another
but, as the result of a good spring salad I had two days ago, I decided
to eat some plant matter today and while I was at the grocery store
getting such necessities as Oreos, milk, ceral (Cracklin' Oat Bran, oh
yeah!), and such, one such item turned out to be an artichoke. I cooked
the thing as was prescribed by the Joy of Cooking and ate it with some
melted butter. So yeah, artichokes are good, even in the opinion of a
primarily carnivorous person such as myself. Now for chips and dip.
