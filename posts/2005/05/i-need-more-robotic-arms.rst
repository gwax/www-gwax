I saw Revenge of the Sith (Star Wars: Episode III) today and it gave me
a thought that Spiderman 2 gave me: I am decidely lacking in the four
robotic arms department. Aside from that, it was a fairly pretty movie
with amuzing fighting and special effects. As far as plotskis go, it's
pretty much a linear interpolation between the end of Attack of the
Clones (Star Wars: Episode II) and the beginning of Star Wars (Star
Wars: Episode IV).

If you want a real review, bug someone else. If you can give me robotic
arms, for the love of god, please do.
