For those of you that don't already know, Osmium is my favorite element.
I found some people on eBay selling Osmium buttons for $31/g and it made
me wish that I had a bunch of money to spend. If you were to ask me how
much I want to have a 30g ball of Osmium, the answer would be "so very
much". Sadly, a 30g ball would cost just shy of $1000 and I don't have
that kind of money to spend on precious metals right now. If I had the
money to spare, you could be sure that I'd have a 5cm diameter button of
Osmium in my possession within the week. This of course means that I need
to wait until I have more money and then start buying Osmium buttons.

Apparently Oliver Sacks (the writer and neurologist) collected Iridium
(second densest element, behind Osmium) buttons and eventually got them
cast into an ingot. Hmm, perhaps I should collect Osmium buttons with
the intention of casting an ingot someday.
