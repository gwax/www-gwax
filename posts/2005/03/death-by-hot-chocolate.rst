In continuing with my recent trend of cooking stuff, I have come across a
recipe for the best hot chocolate ever. I was drinking some earlier this
evening and thinking that I could understand the concept of death by
chocolate. Without further ado, here's what you'll need:

-   1 cup Heavy Cream
-   8-10 oz. Dark/Bittersweet Chocolate (if you're a philistine, like me,
    this is one and a half of those large bars of Hershey's Special Dark
    Chocolate)
-   Some Milk (preferably Whole Milk)

Now, here's what you do. Break the chocolate into lots of little pieces.
In a medium saucepan, over medium heat, bring the cream to a rolling
boil. Once the cream begins to boil, turn off the heat and stir in the
chocolate; keep stirring until the mixture is homogeneous. This cream and
chocolate mixture can be kept in Tupperware in the fridge for later.
This mixture is your concentrate from which to actually make hot
chocolate.

To prepare your hot chocolate, mix the concentrate with milk in a one to
one ratio and heat in a medium saucepan over medium heat. It's so
decadent and delicious.

If I get around to not being cheap, I might go over to the Godiva in the
mall and get some really good chocolate, but that's a later thing. Also,
you can add a little bit of Kahlua for taste or fun.
