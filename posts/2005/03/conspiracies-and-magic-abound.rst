I have just finished reading *The Illuminatus Trilogy* by Robert Shea and
Robert Anton Wilson and have enjoyed every moment of it (a surprising
detail considering my reading habits and its 805 page size). Many thanks
are in order for my good friend Rob Malchow who recommended the book to
me this past summer.

The book is a present day (as of the writing 30 years ago) science
fiction about interwoven conspiracies, politics, mysteries, mysticism and
occultism. The tone ranges from thoroughly lucid to completely absurd
and jumps around too fast, too slow and at the right pace all at once.
You will think that you know what's going on when you do not and vice
versa. The references, real and fake, will amuse you to no end. In the
end, you won't know what's real anymore and you'll have a greater
appreciation for the word "No".
