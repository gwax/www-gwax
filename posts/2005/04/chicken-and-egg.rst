Ok Internet, it's time we had a little discussion about the chicken and
the egg. There's a longstanding pseudo-philosophical debate as to which
came first: the chicken or the egg. The debate rests on two simple
principles: chickens come from chicken eggs and chicken eggs come from
chickens. The whole debate is wildly circular and people like to make it
analogous to other, (less pseudo-) philosophical debates.

Now, because this is a stupid argument, I'm going to set the record
straight. The egg came first. Now some people will launch into stupid
debate with me and say where did the egg come from and to these people I
say, learn some evolutionary biology. The current chicken generation
(generation n) hatched from eggs laid by the previous generation (n-1).
Generation n-1 hatched from eggs laid by generation n-2 and this goes
back for a long time. As you continue to go back, different varieties of
chicken converge and we find, for example, that the Bandara chicken came
originally from an egg that was laid by a White Cornish or by a
Gimmizah; in other words, the first Bandara egg was not laid by a
Bandara chicken. Just as Bandaras can be traced back to eggs that are
not their own, so too can chickens be traced back to an egg laid by some
pre-chicken creature. So there you have it, the egg came first, now shut
up about the damned chicken or egg debate.

It will have to be noted that this solution is theoretical and that
`experimental
tests <http://improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume9/v9i4/chicken_egg.html>`__
suggest that the chicken came first. Having run only one trial, the
results can not be guaranteed to be statistically significant.

As a sidenote, the information about the Bandara chicken came from a
`Breeds of Chicken <http://afs.okstate.edu/breeds/poultry/chickens/chickens.html>`__
site that google got me to.
