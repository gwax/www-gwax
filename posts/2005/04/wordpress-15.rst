I have upgraded my blog to WordPress 1.5, expect things to be in a bit
of a flux state until I work out a few things. If you see anything
missing, not working or just plain wrong, please leave me a comment.

Issues that I have identified so far are:

-  (X)I need to make my categories display nested
-  ( )I need to get my statistics page back
-  (X)I need to play with the colors a bit more
-  ( )I need to get my google search highlighting back
-  (X)Post categories should come at the beginning of posts

Again, if you see anything else, please let me know.
