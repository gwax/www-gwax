My simulation code seems to be working pretty solidly now and I've
gotten almost my entire polyethylene model working. As of right now, I
haven't addressed bond eclipsing and some of my interaction constants
are a little off but, otherwise, everything seems qualitatively good.

Right now I've got my computer running a single
C\ :sub:`100`\ H\ :sub:`202` molecule at 273K. I am performing
calculations for every femtosecond, recording for every picosecond and
it will generate a full nanosecond in about 4 hours. After the
calculations are done, I'll render up images and make a movie, which I
will probably then post somewhere.

I'm a little disappointed in the state of the computation engine but I
don't care; I'm just so glad that I got the model working.

*UPDATE:* It all worked out reasonably well and I have a video up on the
page that I just made up for my
`thesis <link://slug/thesis>`__. Sadly, initial
conditions and physics caused the system to develop a rotational mode
that, combined with some software limitations, makes most of the video
rather uninteresting. The first few seconds are nice. Further things
will be placed on that site as they appear and will, for the most part,
not be mentioned here.
