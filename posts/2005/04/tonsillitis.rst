So I go in to see the nose doctor today with regards to my deviated
septum and I casually mention my recent sore throat. He takes a quick
glance and pretty much says, oh hey, tonsillitis, you should be taking a
higher dosage of penicillin. So he tells me to up my dose to 4 a day and
writes me a prescription for a few more pills. Specialist doctors are
awesome.
