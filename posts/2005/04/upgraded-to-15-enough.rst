As far as I'm concerned, the migration to WordPress 1.5 has been
sufficiently dealt with. I haven't got statistics up yet but that's
because the current version of
`StatTraq <http://randypeterman.com/StatTraq/>`__ doesn't work with my
permalink structure and is kind of hacked for WordPress 1.5; thusly, I
will wait for STatTraq 1.0b before really caring much.

Also, nested comments.
