the worst part about general anesthesia is the 'coming to'. when i had
extensive oral surgery, my mom had to make sure i stayed awake for 40
minutes right afterwards, so they knew i wasn't dead and all that jazz.
the worst 40 minutes of my life (maybe not, but close). all i wanted to
do was drift back into the blissful, drug-filled sleep...
