I've been stressing out about my thesis lately, namely insofar as it not
getting finished and that I've been blowing off time that I should have
spent working on it but it turns out that it's not hard to write when I
actually do so. I've spent the past 3.5 hours hunkered down in my room
and I've churned out 7 pages of pretty decent stuff. If I can get myself
to do this in the future, everything will get finished mighty fast and I
can get back to slacking without stress.

The next thing that I really need to do is add some equations and
diagrams to help make sense of some of what I've written. I also need to
go do some research to get some references and a whole bunch of
background material.

As great as procrastinating is, now is just not the time for it anymore.
