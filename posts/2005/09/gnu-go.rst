I'm a big fan of the board game Go. It's a game that I learned how to
play from my father many years ago. Like Chess, Checkers, etc. there's
no element of chance in the game so it's entirely about strategy and
skill. Go has very simple rules but an incredibly high level of
open-endedness (`wikipedia's Go
page <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28board_game%29#Nature_of_the_game>`__
estimates there being about 10^[number of possible Chess games] possible
Go games). The level of incredible open-endedness and abstract nature of
the game makes it very hard to write computer programs capable of
playing Go any better than an amateur (as opposed to Chess programs,
which are comparable to grandmasters). However, the inability of people
to make good Go playing programs doesn't bug me much because I am an
amateur and so it serves as a good way for me to practice. One such Go
playing program is the freely available `GNU
Go <http://www.gnu.org/software/gnugo/gnugo.html>`__. GNU Go is
currently better than me by a decent bit but I'm slowly working down my
handicap and increasing the board size. GNU Go is text based, so if you
prefer graphics, you might want to get
`PANDA-glGo <http://www.pandanet.co.jp/English/glgo/>`__, which can be
used as a GNU Go frontend or an internet Go program. Anyway, Go is an
excellent game and GNU Go is a decent program.
