The joys of work have presented me the opportunity to discover the wonders of
plastic. These are two photos of a plastic shipping air bag that I
skewered with all the sharp writing implements I could find around the
office. The bag managed to maintain its air pressure and ability to stay
inflated even with all them pencils and that pen in it. I was quite
surprised overall.
