Saw the orthopod again today and got my first does of good news with
regards my shoulder. Apparently the chip in the bone is small and in a
non-critical spot and my glenoid labrum is only minimally damaged. The
orthopod said that I probably have a greater than 50% chance of not
needing surgery and that I can stop wearing the sling as comfort
permits. I'm supposed to start physical therapy soon and that should
slowly get my shoulder working again. As for now, I'm allowed to use it
as much as I feel comfortable so long as I don't carry any heavy loads
with my shoulder or do anything extreme. Even though there's still a
chance of my needing surgery, getting out of the sling and being told
that chances are better of my not needing surgery makes me incredibly
happy.

It may be a little limited but I have two arms again. [Insert
exclamation to non-existent higher power]!
