I don't know whether to get on the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 bandwagon
and it's not because they both look great, it's because neither of them
stands out. I swear, it's like a modern election. I'm pleased by my Xbox
because of its incremental graphical improvements since my Dreamcast and
because of some of its wonderful games but I don't think there's been
anything terribly revolutionary since the NES. The video game industry
has been stuck in a rut of incremental improvements and minor new
gameplay features. The Xbox 360 is turning more into a PC, which
aggravates me because I already have a PC and I don't like the idea of a
modular console. The PlayStation 3 makes me think of a movie industry
parallel, sequels tend to turn out great, sometimes better than the
first but the third in a series usually tends to go downhill: ignoring a
few decent trilogies, look at the Terminator, RoboCop, Predator and
other movie series; why don't you do something new instead of the same
thing again. However, looking at Nintendo, a company I've ignored for
years, we see something kind of interesting; I just watched the `teaser
trailer <http://cube.ign.com/articles/651/651334p1.html>`__ for the new
Nintendo Revolution controller and I was completely wowed. The Nintendo
Revolution controller looks like a completely new approach to video
games; during the first few moments of the video I thought it was just
another cutesy thing like most of what they've been doing but by the end
I was completely agog. The segment of the video where a guy seemed to be
using the controller as a sword practically had me drooling. I've got to
say, if Nintendo can pull off the sorts of things that trailer suggests,
I may become a die hard Nintendo guy like Sherv and Sam.
