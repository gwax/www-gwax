Drive-Ins are making a comeback (as an underground guerrilla movement).
Guerrilla Drive-In movements are apparently popping up all around the
country. The idea is, basically, some guy drags a movie projector and a
radio transmitter to a place with a nice wall and shows a movie. The
place where the movie will be shown is predetermined and people are
informed by mailing list, website or any other if-you-know-where-to-look
method. To view a movie, you show up at the specified place and time and
tune in to the movie's radio station. `Santa Cruz Guerrilla
Drive-In <http://www.thespoon.com/drivein/>`__ seems to be the first,
most popular or just most well known group running Guerrilla Drive-Ins
and they have links up to a number of other similar groups in other
parts of the country.

As of yet, there does not appear to be a group running Drive-Ins in New
England (specifically Eastern Massachusetts) but if I find any, I'll let
you know. Or, if any of you hear of any or decide to start one, drop me
a line and I'll come watch and maybe help out.

For that matter, if I can get my hands on a high luminosity projector, I
will personally obtain everything else that is needed and found a
Guerrilla Drive-In for Eastern Massachusetts. (Anyone want to donate an
old, working projector to the cause?)
