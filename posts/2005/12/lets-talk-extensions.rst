As I expect is rather clear, I use `Mozilla
Firefox <http://www.mozilla.org/firefox>`__ as my primary web browser.
Now, Firefox, has a pretty solid system for adding extensions and there
are rather a few that I use and like, so I thought that I'd let you
folks in on my personal preferences in Firefox Extensions. I've
organized them in the seemingly nonsensical way that my Firefox's
extension manager has, so you'll have to wade through the minor ones as
well as the really keen ones.

-  `BetterSearch <http://bettersearch.g-blog.net/>`__ - gives me
   thumbnails in search pages, kind of nice though not particularly
   useful
-  `mozcc <http://yergler.net/projects/mozcc/>`__ - puts creative
   commons license information in my statusbar, not important but kind
   of nice to know sometimes
-  `Popup ALT
   Attribute <http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/_popupalt.html.en>`__ - gives
   me a little popup bubble of the ALT text when I mouse over an image;
   really nice to have sometimes
-  `IE Tab <http://ietab.mozdev.org/>`__ - allows internet explorer to
   be embedded in a tab; this is unbelievably keen sometimes and means I
   don't ever have to open internet explorer
-  `Live HTTP Headers <http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/>`__ - allows
   me to watch and modify headers; lets me pull some interesting
   chicanery sometimes
-  `Fasterfox <http://fasterfox.mozdev.org/>`__ - uses some hacks to
   make Firefox load pages faster
-  `Dict <http://dict.mozdev.org/>`__ - select a word and look it up
   with dict
-  `Extended
   Statusbar <http://galeb.etf.bg.ac.yu/~ks040161d/firefox/extensions/esb/>`__
   - Adds a lot of information about page loading to my statusbar,
   another keen but not so functional extension
-  `Tab Mix Plus <http://tmp.garyr.net/>`__ - adds multiple tab rows,
   adds tab reordering, adds middle click to close, adds a bunch of
   other stuff; this extension enhances tabbed browsing by an order of
   magnitude and I consider it completely indispensable
-  `Firesomething <http://www.cosmicat.com/extensions/firesomething/>`__
   - changes the browser's name in the titlebar; I love this extension
   and really hope they hurry up and make it compatible with Firefox 1.5
   soon
-  `Disable Targets For
   Downloads <http://www.cusser.net/extensions/disabletarget/>`__ -
   prevents empty windows from being opened for downloads, which gets
   rid of a moderate annoyance
-  `Viamatic foXpose <http://viamatic.com/firefox/>`__ - adds a button
   to your statusbar, which when pressed, gives you a window with
   thumbnails of all your tabs; really keen
-  `Flashblock <http://flashblock.mozdev.org/>`__ - replaces flash with
   a placeholder that you can click to enable individual flash elements;
   indispensable if, like me, you hate 95% of flash but still want to
   use it occasionally
-  `Open Source in
   Tab <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5908>`__ - in
   case it wasn't apparent yet, I like tabbed browsing, this lets me
   view page sources without having to deal with a new window
-  `ChatZilla <http://www.hacksrus.com/~ginda/chatzilla/>`__ - an IRC
   client built on Firefox; it's a clean and decent client, serves my
   needs (I've been IRCing a bit of late)
-  `FireFTP <http://fireftp.mozdev.org/>`__ - an FTP client built on
   Firefox; gives me more FTP functionality when I need it
-  `Download Statusbar <http://downloadstatusbar.mozdev.org/>`__ - puts
   the download manager in my statusbar (I use the mini configuration)
