    I first learned of the White Elephanoceros' existence when I saw him
    appear from nowhere, brutally slaughter someone and then disappear like
    a ghost in the fog. After witnessing his terrible might, I sought out
    information regarding the White Elephanoceros and was able to ascertain
    only that he had a hit list he was working through. Learning of the
    White Elephanoceros' hit list and further managing to ferret out that a
    friend of mine was on the list, I set out to end the White
    Elephanoceros' rampage of death. From what I had witnessed, it appeared
    that the White Elephanoceros was very much corporeal but also very
    ninjalike in methodology; obviously, I needed a very large elephant gun.
    Knowing I must be prepared for the hunt at all times, I kept my gun with
    me at all times.

    Of course, few people know of the existence of the White Elephanoceros,
    so I rapidly attracted unwanted attention carrying an elephant gun
    around with me and was eventually accosted by an officer of the law. The
    officer said something very much akin to, "What the Hell are you doing
    wandering around with a huge rifle like that for?" Making the safe
    assumption that this officer knew nothing of the White Elephanoceros, I
    carefully explained that one of my friends was in grave danger and I
    needed to protect him from a very large white elephant (on first
    inspection you cannot tell that it is an elephanoceros so I simplified
    the description). Surprisingly, the officer responded by telling me that
    if I looked closer, I would have noticed that it has the hindquarters
    and hide of a rhinoceros. I explained that I had neglected to refer to
    it as an elephanoceros because I did not expect him to follow my meaning
    and inquired as to how he knew of its existence. The man explained that
    in his time with the police he had encountered many cases of the White
    Elephanoceros' violence, becoming a bit of an expert on the matter and
    invited me to discuss the matter in greater detail. Following the
    precept "know thy enemy", I took the man up on his offer.

    Hearing the officer of the law's explanation of the White Elephanoceros
    created more questions than it answered. The most interesting matter was
    that the White Elephanoceros was an agent of his own direction and had
    not been hired to work through his hit list. The hit list was the
    central enigma to the workings of the White Elephanoceros; by killing
    the individuals on his list, the White Elephanoceros was engineering the
    future in a very specific manner. The specific origins of the list were
    not entirely clear, but the leading theory was that it had been sent to
    the White Elephanoceros from a possible future in order to either
    prevent or cause that future from coming about. A slightly less popular
    theory proposed that advanced predictions had been run to generate the
    list (a la Foundation Series). There were, of course, other lesser
    theories but the common theme was that the White Elephanoceros was
    carrying out targeted killings to manipulate the future. The discussion
    then turned to the matter of the ethics of interfering with the White
    Elephanoceros; if he was enacting the planned will of a superior system,
    my interference would inevitably cause more harm than good. If the White
    Elephanoceros was an agent for preventing the apocalypse, killing him
    would be the doom of us all. The discussion was quite lengthy and ended
    with disagreement between myself and the officer. The officer believed
    took the fate approach, figuring it unreasonable to alter the proper
    course of events, whereas I don't see the ends justifying the means.
    Being a reasonable man, the officer said that in spite our disagreement,
    my actions were mine to make and he wished me the best of luck in
    whatever I decided to do.

    I will continue to hunt the White Elephanoceros because I consider him a
    malignant force that must be stopped. And you, should heed this warning,
    he is out there and he can appear without warning; you may be on his
    list.

Side note: It occurs to me that the White Elephanoceros can, to some
extent, be considered an allegory for the Divine Plan.
