You look at the clock and it's only 11:30p so you figure you can stay on
IRC a little longer. Then, one discussion on religion and a chat about
Akira Kurosawa films later, it's nearly 2a and you figure you probably
shouldn't have stayed on. Oh well, it's not that big a deal; I still
have a few more days of sleeping in left.
