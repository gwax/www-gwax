McDonald's would like to have you believe that Value Meals are what you want
and that they're cheaper than other options but they're pushing forward
half-truths; Value Meals are what you want (or at least what I want when I'm
not going for the sole purpose of buying fries) but they are not cheaper than
the alternatives. The key to getting a good value at McDonald's is realizing
that the sandwiches in Value Meals are really expensive (>$3) and that double
cheeseburgers are on the dollar menu; in case you want a little wtf, a
normal cheeseburger is more expensive at $1.09. The price of a regular
sized Quarter Pounder Value Meal is $5.09 pre-tax and the price of a
double cheeseburger, large fries and large coke is $4.38 pre-tax, so
where's your value now, Value Meal? Yeah, that's right Value Meal, you
got nothing, punk.

This however is not the end of the story, we haven't gotten to the Super
Secret Value Meal yet. Ok, so about how I was just saying that Value
Meals aren't a value, it's not entirely true because there's an
exception. The exception is what I've decided to call the Super Secret
Value Meal, which is a bit of a misnomer because it's not so much super
secret as just kinda secret, but Super Secret Value Meal sounds a lot
cooler than Kinda Secret Value Meal. I discovered the Super Secret Value
Meal when I looked at my receipt and noticed a funny line that said
VALUE MEAL SAVINGS -0.49; you save money when you buy a sandwich, fries
and drink combo, even if it's not listed as a value meal. George: 1,
McDonald's: >1,000,000,000 served.
