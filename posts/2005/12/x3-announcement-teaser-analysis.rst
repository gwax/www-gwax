Gautham sent out a link to the `X3 Announcement
Teaser <http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/x3/>`__ with the suggestion
that someone might pick the thing apart, so I've taken it upon myself to
do so. Without further ado, here's my analysis of the X3 Announcement
Teaser:

-   They mention trying to cure mutants, which combined with the presence
    of Angel, is a portent of the X-Men storylines that involve
    Apocalypse.
-   They have a large person wearing a helmet, completely bound up, who
    appears later in the trailer and, absolutely, is Juggernaut. I
    disagree with their interpretation and think he should be a good 1-2
    feet taller and about twice as broad.
-   Phoenix is definitely in the movie.
-   Beast is in the movie too.
-   I'm pretty sure I saw the Scarlet Witch, which means the possibility
    of some great bizarroness and that I probably also saw Quicksilver.
-   It looks like Colossus may be taking a more dominant role this time
    around.
-   The scenes with young children may imply that they're going to try to
    draw in some of the younger generations of mutants, probably for
    spin-off purposes later. Storm is hugging one of these children near
    the end, this may be The Spike. I've read that they're already
    planning a Wolverine spin-off, so we may be looking at a great big
    franchise here.

That's the extent of my speculative powers as regards seeing things and
picking apart the context. Looks like it'll be fun and I hope I'm right
about the spin-off franchise bit.
