I've been looking for a game to amuse myself (and others) with that's a
bit more complex and interesting than the standard fare. My current
investigations have led me towards the likes of Nomic, Double Fanucci
and Mornington Crescent.

Double Fanucci is a card game from the Zork series of games. As things
currently stand, Double Fanucci is thoroughly unplayable because I
neither have a deck of Double Fanucci cards nor do I (or anyone else)
have any idea what the rules of Double Fanucci are. Some information
about the game can be found at
`wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_fanucci>`__,
`Encyclopedia
Frobozzica <http://www.irondune.com/words/frobozzica/appc.html>`__ and
`Do-It-Yourself Double
Fanucci <http://www.irondune.com/words/fanucci/index.html>`__. If I
could manage to get a Double Fanucci deck, it might be interesting to
try to construct rules but, until then, there's not much to be done with
regards to Double Fanucci.

Mornington Crescent is a game devised by the BBC radio show `I'm Sorry I
haven't a Clue <http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/clue/>`__. The game is
either easy or hard, depending on whether you get what's going on or
not. The object is fairly simple: be the first to get Mornington
Crescent station. Mornington Crescent is a thoroughly playable game, as
long as you have some creativity, a sense of humor and know how the game
works. In order to learn a bit about the game, take a look at
`Mornington Crescent Illustrated with Expert
Play <http://www.geocities.com/verdrahciretop/mc1.html>`__. Once you
give up trying to figure out what's going on, take a look at what
`wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Crescent_%28game%29>`__
has to say about the game (bit of a spoiler). This is a game that I
should like to find opportunity to play someday despite knowing the
trick behind the game.

Nomic is the most playable of the three, being completely real and
having clear, well-defined rules. The interesting bit about Nomic is
that the rules are modifiable during the course of play. The plastic
nature of the rules is the interesting feature of the game and makes for
very open-ended game play. To get started, take a look at the inventor's
`Nomic page <http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/nomic.htm>`__ and his
`description of
Nomic <http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/nomic.htm>`__ (including
the initial rules). Also, Nomic is pretty popular so you can easily find
plenty more info on the rest of the web. Nomic, being thoroughly
playable, is something that I hope to convince some people to join me in
playing sometime in the near future.
