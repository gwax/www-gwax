Today I bought a new vehicle, specifically a 1993 Ford Explorer XLT.
It's a half-decent vehicle with some minor problems but as far as I'm
concerned the price was very right ($2k). Tomorrow, I'm going to play
the look at my vehicle's innerds game and try to move it from
half-decent to good condition.

Now, when I say that it's more of a truck than a car, that's because, as
far as vehicles go, it feels more like the pick-up trucks that I've
driven than the cars that I've driven. This is in comparison to vans and
some other types of SUV that I've experienced, which feel more like
cars. I assume 1993 must have been before the big everything SUV bubble
hit us.
