I was sitting in my appartment, reading Scud: The Disposable Assassin
(hard to find but absolutely awesome) and I was reminded of Michael
Carroll, the man who introduced me to the likes of Scud. On top of Scud,
Mike introduced me to the comic rendition of The Tick (I was already
aware of the television cartoon) and many other comic books during our
middle school years. Mike's a good man and in addition to having been
one of the best friends that the likes of me could have had, probably
helped in making me the man that I am.

Inspite of not having seen Mike in a few years, I still feel rather
amicable towards him and the experience that triggered this post has
told me that he is inextricably linked with comic books in my mind. In
fact, he's linked with my memories of an entire period of my life. Fancy
that.

In closing, I'd like to raise my metaphorical glass to Michael Carroll,
wherever he may be.
