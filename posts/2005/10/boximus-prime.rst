This is my Boximus Prime costume in robot mode. I was
very pleased, the costume was a big success at Halloween parties last
night. I was also pleased because building the costume gave me something
to do for a while. At some point, I'm going to see if I can get my
brother to video tape me transforming and I'll put it up somewhere for
you all.
