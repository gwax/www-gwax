Halloween is coming on quickly and I have decided to go and make myself a
fancy costume this year. Shortly after waking up today I went and obtained
some of the materials that I need and spent much of the afternoon/early
evening working on my costume. I kept working until I ran out of packing
tape and will pick up where I left off after a trip to the store tomorrow.
With luck I will be well prepared for any Halloween parties I attend
this weekend. Included are some previews images of my costume; it's more
impressive than it looks.
