The internet has brought forth a true hobo bounty. Writer `John
Hodgman <https://www.johnhodgman.com/>`__ has produced a wonderful
spoken word piece consisting of `700 Hobo
Names <http://www.archive.org/details/700HoboNames>`__. I highly
recommend giving it a listen to. Also, word is that someone wants to use
this at Roast, so keep it on the down low at Senior House.
