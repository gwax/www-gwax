Well, it is now no longer 2004. Moving into 2005 I have forgone making
any New Year's Resolutions, mainly because I tend to be making
resolutions all the time and I don't have any particular ones that I
feel like implementing for the specific purpose of the new year.

I spent last evening attending a party at the apartment of a friend of
mine. The party was ok and I got to meet some new people and see old
ones that I had not seen in quite a long time. I got to spend New Year's
Eve with some of the people that I wanted to spend it with and that's
what counts.

Let's do a little bit of prognosticating while we're at the new year
point. I expect this year will have some interesting effects on the
course of my life hereafter. I will be graduating later this year, which
means that by the end of the calendar year I'll either be going to grad
school or be off trying to "find my fortune". We'll see how things work
out.
