I now have a DSL modem for when the DSL to my apartment actually gets
connected. It was a bit of an adventure to get the thing and I will
explain the technique so that others can obtain DSL modems more
efficiently.

#.  Call `speakeasy <http://www.speakeasy.net/>`__
#.  Sign up for DSL service
#.  Don't be in when UPS tries to deliver the DSL modem
#.  Go to the UPS tracking website and ask them to hold the package for
    pick-up
#.  Get annoyed because Third Ave gets cut in half by a bunch of stuff at
    the Cambridge/Somerville border
#.  Take a long annoying detour to deal with the severed Third Ave
#.  Get your package
#.  Decide that you don't want to take the detour again
#.  Find the break in the barbed wire and hop the fence into the MBTA
    train repair facility
#.  Hide in the shadows while a train slowly backs some cars into a
    hangar because you are trespassing
#.  Book it across the train tracks
#.  Find a gap in the barbed wire on the other side and hop the fence
#.  Jump down off a big stone wall
#.  Return home
#.  Congratulations, you now have a DSL modem

Ok, I guess that's not really the best way to get a DSL modem but that's
how I did it.
