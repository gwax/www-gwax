I finished the return trip to Massachusetts today and am writing this
from my room in Concord. Total trip mileage was 3553 (keen, it's
symmetrical). I'll probably get myself back into the city tomorrow,
though it might take more than one day.

Today was an interesting one. I started at a rest area in Virginia where
I ignored the two hour parking limit and got eight hours of sleep.
Between there and New Jersey, things were pretty uneventful. However, an
interesting thing happened when I stopped for lunch and gas in New
Jersey, I picked up a hitch-hiker heading for New York. Mind you, this
was no normal hitch-hiker, this was `Ludovic
Hubler <http://www.ludovichubler.com/>`__ (you'll want to click the
British flag if you can't read French)(also, it's kind of flakey in some
browsers). I'm sure you're asking who is Ludovic Hubler and why should I
care? He's this French guy who is hitch-hiking around the world, trying
not to spend any money at all on travel expenses. He started in France,
hitch-hiked across the Sahara, across the Atlantic, to Antarctica, up to
the US and I gave him a ride from the middle of Jersey to New York.

That's my exciting news of the day; I picked up a hitch-hiker. The first
time I ever pick up a hitch-hiker and I get the hitch-hiker to end all
hitch-hikers.
