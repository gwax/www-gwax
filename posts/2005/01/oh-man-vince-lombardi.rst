I've been underway since 8:30 this morning and am currently getting food
at the Vince Lombardi Service Area in New Jersey. It's overpriced but I
need food and gas for the car.

All gas stations in New Jersey are full service; this is slow,
inefficient and stupid. I am waiting in a fucking line of cars to get
gas! It's so retarded.
