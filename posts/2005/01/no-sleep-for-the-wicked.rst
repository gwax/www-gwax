Well, in theory I'm leaving very early to go skiing on Thursday and I
kind of want to see Ian and Ben's robot for 6.270 at 10a tomorrow so I
don't think that I'm going to sleep tonight. I'm pretty sure that I've
got enough Mountain Dew and Cherry Coke in my apartment to help me stay
up through the night as long as I can find ways to keep myself
entertained.

I don't expect many people to be awake, so AIM isn't going to serve as
an adequate pastime. I haven't got DSL to my apartment yet, so I can't
waste away on the internet or do much with my computer other than watch
movies or tv shows that I already downloaded. I'll make food at some
point but that will occupy a little bit of my time. I might try reading
this book that I found in an Athena cluster (more details likely later).
Maybe I'll steal some Athena paper and do some art. I might even build a
Whitewing.

It may be a little after 5a right now but this night still has a long
time until it's over.
