Oh holy crap, it's blizzarding outside right now, like a whole bunch.
We've probably got about half a foot of snow and some drifts up to two
or more feet; that's not to mention the snow-plow piles that are like 6
feet high. Also, there's like a whole bunch of wind and it's making the
snow fly all over the place and into your face and crap. It's really
cold too. Oh and it's supposed to keep snowing until tomorrow evening.
Also, they declared a state of emergency. I love this kind of weather so
much. Blizzards are the like the bestest things of all.

Also, my sentence constructs are stupid in this post.
