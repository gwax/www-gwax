Last night I saw the `American Repertory
Theatre <http://www.amrep.org/>`__'s rendition of the Greek classic
Oedipus. I already knew the story but that made rather little
difference; the performance was spectacular. The play itself relies
heavily on a variation of the concept of foreshadowing, specifically by
making everything so blatantly obvious that it almost hurts (it's an
amazing technique that works very well). This particular rendition of
Oedipus adds a great deal of strange stylistic bits to the play. It was
kinda weird and very good; I highly recommend it, especially if you've
got a student ID and can get the cheap, student, day-of-show tickets.
