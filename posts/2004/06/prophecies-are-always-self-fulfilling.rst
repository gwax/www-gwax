Last night I saw the `American Repertory Theatre <http://www.amrep.org/>`__'s
rendition of the Greek classic Oedipus. I already knew the story but that made
rather little difference; the performance was spectacular. The play itself
relies heavily on a variation of the concept of foreshadowing, specifically
by making everything so blatantly obvious that it almost hurts (it's an
amazing technique that works very well). This particular rendition of
Oedipus adds a great deal of strange stylistic bits to the play. It was
kinda weird and very good; I highly recommend it, especially if you've
got a student ID and can get the cheap, student, day-of-show tickets.
