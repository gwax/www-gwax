    Cannondale Jekyll 600 (mine is black)

Just because I'm all psyched about my new bike, I thought I might as
well say what sort of bike it is. I got a `Cannondale Jekyll
600 <http://www.cannondale.com/bikes/04/cusa/model-4VN6D.html>`__ (mine
is black). It's quite slick with disk brakes, front shocks with
adjustable travel and damping, rear shocks with adjustable damping and
lockout, and a generally neat style to it. I'm quite pleased and am
having a great deal of fun with it. It's been about six to eight years
since I last had a bike that fit me and I had forgotten how very
pleasant biking is. My bike is an All-Mountain type bike, which means
that it's far more hardcore than I am, but that's something that I can,
and plan to, work on fixing.

Right now, I'm kind of working on getting the hang of and a feel for the
way my bike is. I can get the front tire up pretty easily and fairly
high as well, but the rear tire is a great deal more difficult and I
have a hard time getting it more than a few inches off the ground. I'm
also getting a bit of an idea of what kind of grade of slopes and stairs
I can go up or down.

I'm quite pleased overall and if I'm being a little repetitive, it's
because I'm so enthusiastic about the matter. Now back to work so that I
can finish paying for the thing.
