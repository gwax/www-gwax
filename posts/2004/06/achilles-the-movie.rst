I saw Troy last night and I was both amused and very disappointed. I
came into the thing expecting them to cut out a great deal of stuff, but
I wasn't expecting them to go about completely rewriting the majority of
it and changing the characters themselves. Worst of all, though, is that
they decided to pretty much write out the vast majority of the hero
contingent of the Trojan War. Basically, the movie was loosely based on
the concept of the Trojan War and has relatively little to do with The
Iliad. Besides my disgust, I thought that it was rather well done and
if they had chosen to title the movie Achilles: The Movie, I would have
been totally cool with the whole thing (the The Movie part is rather
key).
