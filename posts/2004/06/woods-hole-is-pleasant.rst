I had forgotten how very pleasant Woods Hole, MA really is. There's
something about the place and the atmosphere that has a soothing effect
on me. I think that I am going to try to make a point of maximizing the
time that I spend here. Maybe I'll see if I can spend my weekends here
as well. If that ends up being the case, appologies will be in order for
those friends of mine that will see less of me as a result.
