It's a real pity that dreams fade from memory as quickly as they do, for
it often leads to the loss of some very interesting dreams. This is the
case for a dream that I had last night; having since showered and made
my way to an Internet connection, much is gone. I'll give you what I
can.

<dream>

I noticed a bit of rust on my bike and set out to find a shop where I
could get the necessary materials to clear the rust and seal over the
wound. While I was in the bike store I remembered that I had some old
rental videos at my house that I needed to return, but I could not
remember what video store I had rented them from. At this point, I
realized that the bike store was, in fact, also a video store,
specifically the one that I owed videos to. I became incredibly
irritated with myself because I had come to this store and not brought
the videos with me. I was chatting with the clerk about various things,
he was a friendly, kind of large, guy and things were pretty cool. He
did recognize me for the guy who owed a lot of overdue charges and I was
a little unsettled because I didn't really care about returning the
videos, but it didn't much matter. The clerk and I were still shooting
the shit and I noticed that this wasn't so much a bike shop as a video
rental store and a toy store all in one.

All of the sudden, the room got darker and all of the walls fell away to
reveal that what had been the store was really just a front for a huge
catedral like building with the store as a little metal frame in the
center. I didn't really know what was going on, except for that I seemed
to have stumbled upon a strange gothic cult, which the shop clerk seemed
to be the leader of. It was a very large cult, and the cathedral seemed
to have stadium seating around the central metal frame (kind of like a
cube with metal edges and no sides). Some people started moving towards
the cube, which contained myself and a few other people that had been in
the store. Then, the cult-leader/clerk shouted out "Recess" and the
lights went out, everything was pitch black.

In the pitch blackness I could feel people moving into the cube and
starting to fill it up, like a rave almost, but no sound and no lights.
I could feel people bumping into me and one person started to get rather
close to me, so I exercised my personal space and put my arm between
myself and the other person. The response I received was, "Fine, see if
I do that again." The response came from a girl, I could tell by the
voice and the physical form, and I suddenly knew that this girl was
special and I absolutely had to get on her good side. The lights came
back (recess must have been over), I could see this mystery girl in
front of me and I knew that she was, not only special, but that I had
always loved her, since long before I had ever met her, this woman was a
divine being. I talked with her for a little while and I felt as though
I had reached the Greek eudaimonia, true happiness. We then parted ways
with the assumption that we would meet again at the next cult meeting
the following week. I then proceeded outside, where I found my brother
and we went to retrieve the car that I was borrowing from my mother.

My brother's appearance seems to have been a brief cameo as he was no
longer there after I had retrieved the car and begun driving. I remember
an interesting rotary that seemed to be on the sidewalk, but I know that
I was allowed to use it with my car and then there's a bunch of stuff
that I've forgotten, which is followed by my being chased by the police.
The police chase led me into Concord, where I decided to duck into a
massive Islamic library (still in my car). I was driving around in this
gigantic library (must have had ceilings that went up 50 feet and there
were about 10 feet between each book stack) and I found myself
completely lost, which, for those that know me, is not a state I often
find myself in. Eventually, I started to walk around, without my car and
I happened on this room that was of unfathomable beauty. There was a
person in this room, presumably a librarian or holy-person of some sort,
whom I asked for help getting out of the library. Help was offered in
the form of an offer to be let out somewhere in Europe to which I
responded, "What?! I entered this library in Concord!" It then turned
out that this library attendant could let me off in Concord as he was
going by that way. It appears that there is only one giant Islamic
library in the world and it can be entered from what appear to be all of
the other Islamic library building in the world (I really can not stress
how very big this place was and with all sorts of magical links and
shortcuts). I noticed spectacular piece of cloth and asked the attendant
what it was, only to receive the respone that since I had touched it, it
would have to be destroyed. I tried to argue against its destruction on
the grounds that it was one of the most beautiful things to have every
graced the universe, but the attendant steadfastly maintained that since
I had touched it, it would have to be destroyed. Henceforth, I touched
nothing and somewhere along the way to the exit, I woke up.

It seems as though in starting from the beginning and just writing as
things went, I have remembered a lot of what I forgot. Keen.
