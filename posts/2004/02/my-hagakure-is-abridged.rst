My Hagakure is abridged!

I recently decided to reread my copy of Hagakure: The Book of the
Samurai by Yamamoto Tsunetomo (I have the William Scott Wilson
translation) and in reading the Foreword I discovered that it's an
abridged version. William Scott Wilson decided only to publish about 300
of the roughly 1300 passages in the actual Hagakure. Mister Wilson has
done a very good job of choosing ~300 exceptional passages, but it
leaves me wanting. I have my principles (some eccentric) and I don't
like reading books in an abridged form.

As a further note, I have looked to see if there are any unabridged
copies in English and come up with nothing. I was also unable to locate
any complete copies in the original Japanese (though this may be my
fault and not due to their non-existence).
