|dancing hippo| It occurred to me, while looking at `Hippo's
blog <http://fluxion.mit.edu/blog/>`__ that I would do well to add the
ability to have pictures accompany my blog entries. It's not that I have
any good pictures to add right now, but at some point I might. Now, I
could have thought about it a bunch and come up with a good bit of CSS
on my own, but I'm lazy so I just stole and modified some of `Hippo's
blog's CSS <http://fluxion.mit.edu/blog/layout2.css>`__. Some people
might say that I'm a bad person, but at least I'm giving credit where
credit is due. Of course, on the other hand, I'm not giving any credit
for the hippo image that I found somewhere else on the Internet and have
since forgotten the origin of; I'm pretty sure that I Google-imaged for
'hippo'. Well, I guess I actually am a bad person then; oh well.

Now watch the dancing hippo as he hypnotically makes lewd gestures for
your amusement.

*UPDATE 2005-09-21:* I have long since stopped using this method for
figures and instead now use class="alignright" and some CSS taken from
the default (Kubrick) theme for Wordpress 1.5.
