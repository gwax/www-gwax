Hey, it's Friday the 13\ :sup:`th`. What's more, it's Friday the
13\ :sup:`th` in a February. In normal cases, a February Friday the
13\ :sup:`th` means that there will be three Friday the 13\ :sup:`ths`
(I'll leave that to you to proove for yourself), but this is no ordinary
case; this year is a leap year. That is all.
