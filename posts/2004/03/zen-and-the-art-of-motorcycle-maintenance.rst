I have just finished reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenace by
Robert M. Pirsig and to say that I was moved would be to make a gross
understatement. I started to choke up a few chapters before the end and
spent the last two in tears; this book has struck a very powerful chord
with me and I would have a very hard time explaining why to anyone that
has not also read the book. The chord that this book has struck is a
very deep one indeed. I am at a loss for further words.
