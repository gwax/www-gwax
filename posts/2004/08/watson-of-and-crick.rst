Watson, the DNA guy, gave a talk, which I attended, at the MBL last
night. It was an interesting talk even though it was mostly just an
autobiographical sort of talk. I was actually kind of pleased that it
wasn't a talk about something scientific because I wasn't really in the
mood for that, as such.

Autobiographical talks are always kind of nice because they let you get
an impression of the kind of person that someone is, and I like that
stuff. Turns out that Watson spent some time in Woods Hole and
experienced the Woods Hole thing. He mentioned things such as the
Captain Kidd, which is the local bar that tends to be frequented by MBL
sorts. It's kind of fun to think that I'm going to the same bar with my
to-be-scientist friends that Watson used to go to with his scientist
friends. Ah Woods Hole, such great traditions you have. I also have a
little quote that I took from him, which I would like to reproduce here,
"They were the sorts of parties where you got drunk and the person you
went home with was probably not your wife." He is, of course, discussing
parties in Woods Hole of his youth and is probably admitting to
fornication and not to adultery. Incidentally, if you can picture the 76
year old, co-discoverer of DNA making this remark, imagine the response
of a huge crowd of educated people.

It was a good talk, and there are more important and insightful ways in
which I could discuss it, but I'd rather not because plenty of other
people will have that bit covered. The key thing that I took from it was
that J. D. Watson was just another young scientist in Woods Hole, like
so many of the rest of us.
