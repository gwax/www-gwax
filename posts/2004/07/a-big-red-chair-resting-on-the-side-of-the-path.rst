I was out biking earlier today, enjoying myself immensely, when I
happened to come across a big red chair resting on the side of the path.
I rode past it and then realized that I had passed a big red chair
resting on the side of the path. I turned around and went back and, as I
had expected, the big red chair resting on the side of the path was a
big red chair resting on the side of the path. There wasn't much else to
do so I put down my bike, removed my helmet, removed my gloves and sat
down in the big red chair restingon the side of the path for a while.
One doesn't often find a big red chair resting on the side of the path.
The big red chair resting on the side of the path was out of place yet
incredibly appropriate and I was very glad to have encountered it.
