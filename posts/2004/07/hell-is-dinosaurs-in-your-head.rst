Yesterday was going pretty well up until I decided to go to sleep; good
day at work, helped Dave G-L paint for a while, invited to dinner at the
Galvin's, Cha-cha and swing at the MBL Club, a few beers with some of my
chummers at the Kidd; all in all a pretty good day. So then, as I was
saying, it all went downhill pretty darned fast thereafter. I got home
around 12:30a and went promptly to sleep.

<dream>

    I woke up around 4a for no seemingly good reason, went back to sleep and
    then here is where the fun begins, and by that I mean exactly the
    opposite. Over the course of the next 4 hours (since 8a is when I like
    to get up for work) I went through veritable weeks of dream time, all of
    which were incredibly vivid and of a Jurassic Park kind of nature. The
    worst moments were those of being stalked through an office building by
    a number of malicious velociraptors, watching the slaughter of dozens of
    people around me, and the best moments were not a whole lot better.
    These were the sorts of dreams that one finds to be hard to distinguish
    from reality, like when you're worried about a test, take it in a dream
    and wake up relieved to have taken it only to later realize that it was
    just a dream. It was that sort of realism that leaves you unsure of
    things for a bit, except in that it was no test but, instead, large
    predatory reptiles out for my blood. I took up so much dream time and it
    was so vivid that, when I finally got out of bed in the morning, I was
    quite shaken and just a little jumpy.

Now, nearly two hours later, some of the horrors remain in my head and I
am still a bit shaken and jumpy. I'm half expecting to hear screaming
and then discover dinosaurs stalking around the MBL, where I work. This
is, of course, not aided by being slightly out of it because of the
sleep the horrors deprived me of in the first place.
