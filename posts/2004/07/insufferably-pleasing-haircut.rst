I continue to be insufferably pleased with my mohawk. The general
response of other people has been favorable and I haven't had to put up
with much negative response, which is good because I like the haircut
for me and don't much want to deal with other people that feel
otherwise. Maintenance is a pain, as I have to shave the sides of my
head every few days, but it's worth it.

My beard is also getting back to a length that pleases me a great deal.
I guess that I could say that I am very pleased by all of the hair that
grows on my head.
