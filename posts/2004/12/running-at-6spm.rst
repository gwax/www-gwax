So there's this wonderful thing called the **Saltine Challenge**. The
challenge is simple but different people seem to have different versions
of it but certain aspects are universal. The basic premise is to eat as
many Saltines as possible in 60 seconds. Some people say that 6 crackers
is impossible, others say 8 is impossible and some just try to eat as
many as they can; I fall into the last category. Important to the
challenge is that you are not allowed to have any other food or drinks
within the span of the challenge. Also, only crackers that have been
fully swallowed count; if you try to put 8 in at once but don't finish
swallowing, you get 0; if you're on your 5th cracker when time runs out,
only 4 count.

Back in the day, some friends and I got together at Quuxfield (Riad,
Amrys and Rodin's apartment at the time) and amongst other things
undertook the challenge. Back then, Riad managed to get 6 down in a
minute, I was able to get 5 and I think that hippo managed 4.

Anyway, I was eating some Saltines (Nabisco Premium to be specific) and
I decided to give the challenge another go. This time I managed to get
down 6 crackers in one minute, thus pulling in a rate of 6 saltines per
minute (6SPM).

How many can you manage?
