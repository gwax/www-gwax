For those of you unfamiliar with the concept of a true name, basically,
if you knew the true name of a spirit you could use it to invoke said
spirit and have power over said spirit. An example you may recognize is
that of Beetlejuice, saying the name "Beetlejuice" thrice invoked him or
dismissed him and so on and so forth.

It occurred to me recently that a cellphone number is very much
conceptually akin to the mystical concept of a true name. If you have
someone's cellphone number you can call them anywhere and theoretically
invoke them as well. You are granted power over an individual by being
able to contact them at any time. Also, just as with summoned demons, if
you invoke people for stupid reasons they will take it out on you.
