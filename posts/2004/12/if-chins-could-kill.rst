I was in Barnes & Noble recently and I found Bruce Campbell's
autobiography If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor (I
know that I mentioned this is an earlier post, but it deserves a full
entry).

So yeah, anyway, it's a really awesome book. Basically, it's a good
behind the scenes look at the film and television industry and gives you
the impression that Bruce Campbell really is a good guy. Truth be told,
I grabbed the thing because I'm a pretty big fan of the guy's work and
turned out to really enjoy reading the book. It's got a good colloquial
feel to it and I was able to get through it in two sittings (long
sittings because I read slowly, but two nonetheless). Sadly, it's been
rather a while since I last finished a book, but I guess that's kind of
a testament to how much I enjoyed this book.

So yeah, I highly recommend this book for any Bruce Campbell fan, B
movie fan, Sam Raimi fan, film buff or anyone else looking for a good
read.
