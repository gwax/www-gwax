Let me just start by saying that I love winter and I especially love
snow, it's just so beautiful and fun. Also, you get a real quiet during
snow storms that you don't tend to get very often otherwise. In fact, as
far as I'm concerned, snow is the bestest.

Amrys apparently has `a similar
sentiment <http://amrys.chronosilence.org/blog/archives/001686.html>`__.
