Christening a new section of my www server, where I will keep
information that I deem to be important to make public, I have put up a
copy of the `Report of the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) on the treatment by the Coalition forces of prisoners of war and
other protected persons by the Geneva Conventions in Iraq during arrest,
internment and
interrogation <link:///icrc_iraq.pdf>`__.
The thing has a long title, but I wanted to put it all in there so that
there was no bullshitting around. Suffice it to say, this isn't pretty.
I'm sure that most of you out there know that the Geneva Conventions say
no torturing but that's pretty much what we're systematically doing to
people we deem valuable in Iraq. If we're going to set ourselves up as
the police of the world shouldn't we at least obey the world laws? Isn't
this the kind of thing that we went into Iraq to stop?

*UPDATE 2005-09-23:* I have removed the report from my information
folder because I realized that I don't actually care about the report. I
care about the incidents described, but not the report itself.
