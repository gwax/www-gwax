I noticed a funny thing earlier today as I was listening to NPR (I think
that I was listening to talk of the nation specifically). Between show
segments they play little bits of music and one of the little bits of
music that they played was from one The Flaming Lips' songs. Hearing The
Flaming Lips and then realizing that it was NPR just reaffirmed my view
that somebody out there has good taste in music (it was a good piece and
I've also heard them play lots of other good music in their interludes).
