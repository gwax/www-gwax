I have recently been conducting research in the field of Tootsie Roll
Pops and have become quite enamored with the question of how many licks
it takes to reach the center. I have taken a systematic approach and
begun research in an attempt to answer the question. I am also in the
process of writing a `scientific paper <link://slug/tootsiepop>`__ on the matter.
Feel free to read the paper in its current form, but I stress that it is
a work in progress and that data is currently not sufficient to be
reliable. If you or anyone else would be willing to conduct tests and
provide me with data I would be greatly appreciative for the extra data
points.
