I came across this nifty post-apocalyptic, sci-fi radio show on the
internet called `Tales From The Afternow <http://theafternow.com>`__. It's
kind of like Mad Max meets Shadowrun meets Neuromancer meets etc. but it's
all audio like one of those old fashioned radio fictions. It's pretty neat
and I recommend giving it a listen, even if you decide against it after
the first one.
