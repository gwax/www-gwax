As a follow up to a previous entry
`NPR and The Flaming Lips <link://slug/npr-and-the-flaming-lips>`__,
today I heard a portion of a Fantastic Plastic Machine song during one
of the short interludes on NPR. Once again, I am thoroughly pleased by
NPR's eclectic musical tastes. In case it varies from NPR station to
NPR station, I am referring to WBUR 90.9FM, broadcast out of Boston
University in Massachusetts.
