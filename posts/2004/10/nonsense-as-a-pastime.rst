I've come up with a wonderful new pastime for when I to get bored in
class or otherwise during the day, writing nonsense. It's a ton of fun
to write and then it's kind of fun to read, although it lacks more than
very short range coherence. Here is a short excerpt:

   ...to soon coon moon toon buffoon interpretive dance romance chance
   clance manse rancid meat spontaneous generation swirl twirl curl
   divergence charge up a hill at the enemy who has entrenched in the
   superior position no matter we have more troops and your dog is
   expendable or perhaps your dog is expandable mandible click-clack
   giant ant flying into the mantis spongiform boast defeat in the realm
   of the manifest destiny collapse from sense to gibbering like four
   golf carts which we eat to cut down on excess protein put the spoon
   in your mouth...

Maybe I'll put more up later, but for now it serves to illustrate a
point. Of course, feel free to call it crap, it very well may be, but I
enjoy the act of writing it. It's mainly just word play and random word
association mixed with a bit of stream of consciousness.
