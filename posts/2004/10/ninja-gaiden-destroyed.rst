As of a day or so ago, I have finally destroyed the heck out of Ninja
Gaiden. I have collected all 50 Scarabs to unlock the original Ninja
Gaiden and I have shot the clock tower to get Ninja Gaiden II and found
Ninja Gaiden III in the Aquaduct. It has been a long time coming and it
is now done. Of course, I did beat the game on normal difficulty so I
may, sometime far off, end up playing through again and beating it on a
harder difficulty.

Victory is mine, time to go back to trying to destroy some other games,
like Project Gotham Racing or such.
