<dream>

    I'm at some zoo with a bunch of people from my high school. Now,
    mind you, these are not my friends from high school or anything, just a
    bunch of the other people. So we do the whole zoo thing and on the way
    out I realize that I'm really thirsty so I make a bee line for the
    little refreshments stand at the entrance to the zoo. I notice a few
    people stopping at water fountains as I pass them. In my hurry I manage
    to make it to the entrance before everyone else. Noticing that they have
    a mini Dunkin' Donuts I order me a nice fruit flavored Coolata and wait
    while it's prepared. It turns out that the machine is broken and at this
    point the lead I got on everyone is lost and they're all back at the bus
    waiting for me. Aggravated as I am, I'm still thirsty so I order a large
    lemonade, which is $2.32. I pay for the lemonade with two ones, a
    quarter, a nickel and two pennies. Now the damned lady won't serve me my
    lemonade, she just makes me wait and wait and wait. Everyone is probably
    getting pissed because I'm making them wait and for the love of God, why
    won't she just serve me my lemonade. Then I woke up.

So I got up, took a shower and then realized that I really did want a
fucking Coolata. The problem of course was that I didn't really want to
bother walking to Dunkin' Donuts up in Central Square so I decided to
just go to soda fridge and get me a Minute Maid Fruit Soda. Then, soda
fridge was out of Fruit Sodas. At this point, I was more than just a
little aggravated, I was really fucking pissed off. Finally, I went to
munchies and bought some citrus flavored Sobe drink, which managed to
serve as a mediocre alternative.

So that's my morning thus far, and quite frankly, I am really aggravated
right now.
