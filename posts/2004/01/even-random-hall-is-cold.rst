My dormitory, Random Hall, has this incredible knack for always being
too hot. It doesn't matter what time of year, it doesn't matter what
kind of weather, Random is just too hot. Now, with a track record like
that in place, why am I wandering around inside, wearing a fleece and
gloves, yet still being cold. What has happened here?

0°F with a wind chill of -17°F is just not something that I'm used to.
Normally I'm a pretty cold tolerant person too, but for some reason I
haven't been taking to it as kindly as usual. And why is there no snow.
I want a blizzard; spend some more time vacationing in the B-Lizard
Lounge, sipping on a tropical drink and doing some hot latin dancing.
