Ozone Beast, such a good friend you are

So, there's this irritating little thing about my personal web page,
namely, the internet (google and MIT's search service) see fit to index
it as being at `ozone-beast.mit.edu <http://ozone-beast.mit.edu/>`__ and
not as the preferred `gwax based domain <http://www.gwax.com/>`__.
Needless to say, it irritates me to have a domain name and then have
search service ignore it, so I've gone and used php to tack on a little
note at the top if anyone tries to access it without using a gwax domain
name. Try visiting it via ozone-beast if you want to see the note, or
don't bother if you don't care.

While, I'm on the subject of ozone-beast, let me just say how much I
love that machine. Mind you, ozone-beast isn't a very good computer, but
it's massive and awesome. Ozone-beast is a dual Pentium
something-or-other, with a few hundred megs of RAM and 16GB of RAID5.
I've failed to put a number of different OSes on the beast including
Windows 2k, Debian and some others, but have managed to get NT4 working
fine. Ozone-beast runs all of my DNS and my personal web server.

Ozone-beast might sound like a funny name, but it's got perfectly
reasonable roots. When I first got the thing it pumped out gobs of ozone
and made a terrible amount of noise. It's a beast and it makes ozone,
hence ozone-beast. Now it doesn't pump out nearly so much ozone (I
suspect that the fans were the cause of that), but it certainly makes
just as much noise. I usually have a love-hate relationship with most of
my computers, but not ozone-beast, there's no hate there.

Ooh, I almost forgot, it's got wheels too.
