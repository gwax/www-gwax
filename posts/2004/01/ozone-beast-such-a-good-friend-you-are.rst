So, there's this irritating little thing about my personal web page,
namely, the internet (google and MIT's search service) see fit to index
it as being at `ozone-beast.mit.edu <http://ozone-beast.mit.edu/>`__ and
not as the preferred `gwax based domain <https://www.gwax.com/>`__.
Needless to say, it irritates me to have a domain name and then have
search service ignore it, so I've gone and used php to tack on a little
note at the top if anyone tries to access it without using a gwax domain
name. Try visiting it via ozone-beast if you want to see the note, or
don't bother if you don't care.

While, I'm on the subject of ozone-beast, let me just say how much I
love that machine. Mind you, ozone-beast isn't a very good computer, but
it's massive and awesome. Ozone-beast is a dual Pentium
something-or-other, with a few hundred megs of RAM and 16GB of RAID5.
I've failed to put a number of different OSes on the beast including
Windows 2k, Debian and some others, but have managed to get NT4 working
fine. Ozone-beast runs all of my DNS and my personal web server.

Ozone-beast might sound like a funny name, but it's got perfectly
reasonable roots. When I first got the thing it pumped out gobs of ozone
and made a terrible amount of noise. It's a beast and it makes ozone,
hence ozone-beast. Now it doesn't pump out nearly so much ozone (I
suspect that the fans were the cause of that), but it certainly makes
just as much noise. I usually have a love-hate relationship with most of
my computers, but not ozone-beast, there's no hate there.

Ooh, I almost forgot, it's got wheels too.

Update for posterity: Ozone Beast was a `Dell PowerEdge 4100 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dell_PowerEdge_Servers#Generation_1>`_.
