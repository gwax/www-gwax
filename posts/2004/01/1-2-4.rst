For those of you that get the reference, I appologize; to the rest of
you, I also appologize. This entry exists for two reasons, the first is
to put "1... 2... 4!" somewhere else on the internet (it has already
shown up in the webcomics
`Underverse <http://underverse.net/index.php?id=15>`__ and `Ketchup
Popsicle <http://web.mit.edu/dmax/www/kp/8.html>`__) and the second is
to give you all a good example of how broken my sense of humor really
is.

So here it goes: "1... 2... 4!" is my favorite joke. There is no more to
the joke; what is in quotation, is all that there is. If you don't get
the it, your only real option is to think about it until you figure out
what makes it so funny or just give it up as not funny. There is no
additional context and it is only an inside joke insofar as a few of my
friends also find it humorous. Chances are pretty good that you don't
get it, won't get and will just end up irritated with me. It's just kind
of surrealistic that way.

And yes, I am serious, this is my favorite joke.
