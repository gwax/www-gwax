Ok, so I think that I've gotten this blog thing set up to my heart's
content. Now I think that I'll probably go about finding other ways to
waste my time for a while.

Oh, by the way, if my banter seems a bit inane and boring, it's probably
because I just started on this blog thing. So bear with me, it'll
probably take a little while for the perturbations to work their way out
and for me to reach a steady-state.
