An old friend of mine, Michael Carroll, whom I haven't seen in quite a
while, just requested that I add him as a friend in
`Friendster <http://www.friendster.com/>`__ and it has reminded me of
that whole thing. Having been reminded, I did a quick look through to
find and add a few more people that I know to my friend's
thingamahoozit.

I don't know if I really have much intention of picking up and using
Friendster in any real fashion but it might serve me well as a means of
keeping track of people that I don't see very often. At the very least
it can sometimes remind me that there are some people out there that I
know and would like to see but don't always get the chance to.

Oh, and yes, this means that I am on Friendster for those of you that
know me and were unaware of this fact. For those of you that don't know
what Friendster is, it's an online thing that mainains networks of
friends and helps you connect with people that you may know indirectly.
