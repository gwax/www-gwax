Having recently watched the amazingly good Bubba Ho-tep, I feel that I
ought to give it a little plug. After all, it's out on DVD and VHS and
more than worth renting. It's one of those humor/horror movies that
isn't scary but is really amusing. Also it has Bruce Campbell, of Army
of Darkness fame, as Elvis.

In case you won't just take my word for the quality of this movie, I'll
give you some more details to help convince you. Bubba Ho-tep is set at
an old folks home in Texas somewhere near the present. The main
characters are Elvis and JFK (who is, incidentally, black) as
geriatrics. Now, throw a soul-eating mummy into the mix and you have
one of the worst ideas for a movie ever. In an odd twist, a really bad
movie idea becomes a really amusing movie; which might make sense if you
consider how many really great movie ideas make for really poor movies.
In short, Bubba Ho-tep is a movie that tried to combine the amusement
value of mummies, Elvis, JFK, old people and the South and managed to
pull it off.
