So, I'm driving home this evening (~2a) just minding my own business as
I do. It's late at night so there shouldn't be many cars on the road and
I can see them in advance by their headlights anyway. I come around a
corner and the rest is best explained if I simply relate the immediate
sequence of my thoughts after I turn the corner:

-   DEER!
-   HOLY FUCK!
-   BRAKE!
-   SON OF A BITCH!
-   BRAKES LOCKING!
-   LET UP!
-   BRAKE AGAIN!
-   OH CRAP!
-   Wait, I'm ok.
-   Heart, you can start again.

I won't be all melodramatic and be like, "I could have died, I was so
scared." No, I'm cool, but it was pretty startling and more than a
little frightening at the time.

That's my harrowing experience of the day, now for some sleep
