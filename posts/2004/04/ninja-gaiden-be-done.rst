It has taken me a great deal of time and effort but I have finally
finished Ninja Gaiden. Anyone that says that this game is not hard is a
boldfaced liar but, thankfully, it's not usually the frustrating kind of
hard. Ninja Gaiden is great and I highly recommend it; ignoring
Soulcalibur 2, probably one of the best video games that I have played
in quite a while. So yeah, I beat Ninja Gaiden and I'm all proud of
myself now.
