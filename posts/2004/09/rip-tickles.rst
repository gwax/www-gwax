Today is a sad day for the world, Mr. Tickles has died. Mr. Tickles was
a friendly fish, loved by all who made his acquaintance. To some he was
just a fish, to others he was always bigger than the time before, but to
me he was my dear friend Tickles.

Tickles, I will remember you fondly for all the amusing times we have
had. I will remember how I would sit and watch you swim around. I will
remember the time you bit Kurt. I will remember how you would eat
guppies with such glee when you were given the opportunity. I will
remember how you would watch me at my computer. I will remember how you
would swim around so excitedly at feeding time. I will remember how you
would change colors so subtly, confounding me until I realized that
you could change colors. I will remember your ability to be constantly
larger than you had been before. I will miss you Tickles.

Mr. Tickles was a Tiger Oscar Cichlid and died of a fungal infection
this afternoon, Saturday, September 25th 2004, at about 1PM. Mr. Tickles
died at the ripe age of 1 year old; he was 9 inches long at the time of
his death, far more than the 3-4 inches of when we first met.
