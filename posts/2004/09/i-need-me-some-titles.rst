I was thinking about titles earlier and how much I need more of them.
The problem with getting official titles is that you need to earn them
or you're just a hack when you try to use them. I've been thinking about
various different titles that I want and what I would need to do in
order to earn them. I figure chances are pretty good that I'll be
getting a Ph.D. at some point, which will get me the title "Doctor". I
figure that I'll have to find a way to get knighted, which will get me
the title "Sir". I'm also going to have to become a preacher so that I
can get the title "Reverend". Becoming a judge would get me a "The
Honorable" as a prefix. If I can buy or marry myself into some sort of
lordship, I can get the title "Lord" at the beginning and then some sort
of fancy suffix like "Duke of someplace-or-other"; however I'm inclined
to believe that Lord and Sir are mutually exclusive. Then, if I spent
some time in one of the armed services, I could get my hands on
something like "Commodore" or "Brigadier General". Certainly there are
other nifty titles that would be great, but I think that I'm pretty far
along the way to making my point.

The end result of all my work would be that I would officially be The
Honorable Lord Reverend Doctor Brigadier General Waksman, Duke of
someplace-or-other and that would just be flat out awesome. Oh, and
think about the letterheads on my stationary.

I think that I've got my life set out for me now.
