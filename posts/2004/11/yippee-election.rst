Well, the election was yesterday and I voted; it was kind of cool, I
guess. Last night I went over to Burton-Connor to hang out with Nick and
watch the results come in; the hanging out was more interesting than the
results, which is kind of sad. It's been pretty much deadlocked and it
still is, with neither candidate claiming victory, though it looks like
Bush has won. In the end, I only care a little bit because I see it as a
one party election where we are voting between Rich Capitalist A and
Rich Capitalist B. I am just so disillusioned that I don't really care.
Maybe if Bush wins he'll drive this country into the ground so fast that
no one will be able to hide that rich people own our government. Ok, I'm
done being cynical and sarcastic; back to apathy. George out.
