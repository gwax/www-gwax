I am often rather annoyed by the fact that many webpages out there on
the Internet use broken and disgusting HTML that will not render
properly in my browser (Firefox). Usually it is the case that the pages
are trying to do stupidly complex and useless things to look cool or
they are being constructed by complete amateurs. Some sites claim to be
compliant but are in fact not, but more often people don't even bother
to go that far. Sometimes, however, it is the webpages of people or
groups that I would expect to know what they're doing. Standards are the
solution to this problem. In a quick run through, for example, only one
of the blogs on my blogroll is actually standards compliant; though some
come close, most are grossly erroneous.

Folks, it's not that hard to see what you're doing wrong, just swing by
`The W3C Markup Validation Service <http://validator.w3.org/>`__ and see
what isn't right with your website. Even if you don't want to go through
all the effort of making your page fully standards compliant, you might
try using the validator to see what some of the errors on your site are.

To be honest, I usually don't much care about standards compliance from
other sites but I do care a whole lot when a site does not render
correctly because it's malformed.

So, in short, bitch bitch bitch, peoples' sites don't work right, bitch
bitch bitch.
