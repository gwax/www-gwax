This morning, I purchased a cup of coffee, a Caf√© au lait to be
specific. What makes buying a cup of coffee noteworthy is that it's the
first cup of coffee that I have purchased, or even consumed for that
matter, in about 3 years. I don't normally drink coffee for reasons that
date back to my Junior year of high school.

I found high school exceedingly easy and, as a result, I was almost
constantly bored. In spite of the fact that I usually did my homework
during other classes so as to avoid doing it at home, I rarely slept
sufficiently--a habit that I've carried with me since. The not sleeping
meant I drank coffee in the mornings, rather a decent amount. The
boredom, and who I am, led to experiments of all sorts. Eventually, the
logical happened, I combined my coffee with my experimenting. I usually
made coffee with our `Moka
Express <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_Express>`__--a phenomenal
device for making good coffee by the way--so that served as the platform
for my experimentation. Mokas produce rather tasty and very potent
coffee. My first experiment involved the production of three Mokas worth
of coffee, which were then boiled down to the volume of a single mug;
the boiling down concentrated the caffeine but absolutely ruined the
flavor. Experiment one was a resounding success; I was alert, wired and
full of energy all day, though I did crash at the end of the day and
become quite exhausted. At the time, I had a bit of a penchant for
consuming cake frosting (if only I still had my teenage metabolism) and
I suspect the container I ate that day helped maintain blood-sugar
levels against the energy draining effects of caffeine. Obviously, my
second experiment, which occurred a number of weeks later, involved the
same process and four Mokas; again there was cake frosting and it was
quite a success, though I did suffer some jitters and stomach
discomfort. Worth noting, I estimate a caffeine content of approximately
200mg per Moka, with `acute overdose
levels <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Caffeine_intoxication>`__
starting somewhere around the 300mg range, modulo tolerance;
hospitalization can be necessary for as little as 2000mg. Not willing to
be deterred, or perhaps just being a complete idiot, later on came
experiment three: five Mokas boiled down to one cup. Experiment three
was a complete failure, perhaps there was too much caffeine, perhaps it
was a lack of cake frosting; whatever the reason, I was done in. I
couldn't focus; my hands shook to a large degree; I was nauseated to the
point of vomiting; it took a substantial portion of my willpower to hide
my situation from my teachers and peers, eventually making it through
the day, collapsing in bed and sleeping for an excessive period of time.

Aside from the negative effects immediately following experiment three,
I developed a strong psychosomatic allergy to the flavor of coffee, as
indicated by an inability to stomach decaffeinated coffee, coffee ice
cream or anything with a hint of coffee flavor while still being able to
consume large quantities of caffeinated soda. Every so often, I have
tried to consume something coffee related, usually trying for very
minimally coffee options, and I have slowly found myself more capable of
stomaching them. Most recently, I think that I had a bottled Starbucks
frappuccino drink thing and was only somewhat nauseated by the
experience.

Today, however, I would say that I have only been minimally nauseated;
to such a minimal extent, I would say, that I may see about bringing
coffee back into my life. My psychosomatic coffee intolerance is a
weakness of constitution that I would really like to kick. Further
testing is clearly necessary but I am cautiously optimistic.
