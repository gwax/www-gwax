`Arthur C. Clarke
died <http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-clarke19mar19,0,393161.story>`__
today in Sri Lanka at the age of 90. I won't even try to summarize the
amazing things that Arthur C. Clarke has contributed to the world, I
wouldn't be able to do him justice; if you care, `ask
wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke>`__. Rest in
peace Sir Arthur C. Clarke and thank you for all that you've given us.

I'll leave you with Clarke's three laws:

#.  When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is
    possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something
    is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
#.  The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture
    a little way past them into the impossible.
#.  Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
