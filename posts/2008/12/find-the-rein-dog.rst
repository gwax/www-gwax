This past Saturday was `SantaCon <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SantaCon>`__
here in San Francisco and, for the second time, I attended. This year, I
dressed Baldr up as a rein-dog and brought him along for the romp. We had a
fantastic time and Baldr was unquestionably the star of the day, with
dozens upon dozens of people taking photos with or of him.

Baldr's popularity on Saturday brings me to a challenge: I challenge you
to find as many photos of Baldr as you can; leave links in the comments.
I have attached a particularly cute one that I
`found <http://www.flickr.com/photos/sharpshutter/3106926317/>`__ to get
you started, but I have seen others out there.
