What makes something alive?

I realized, this morning, that I objectify yeast. Sure I objectify meat,
vegetables, trees and, heck, even some people but, even when I'm doing
so, I don't lose sight of the fact that these things are or were living
beings. Yeast, however, I treat a great deal more like a chemical or
tiny machine. Yeast is something that I add to
`wort <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wort_%28brewing%29>`__ to make beer;
sure I need to temperature control it and keep things clean but that's
the case with lots of wet chemistry. If I didn't know better, I might
think of yeast as little more than a catalyst for converting sugar to
ethanol and carbon dioxide; there are nuances and yeast imparts other
processing to the wort but those are minor details. Continued thinking,
combined with various old thoughts of mine and some of my personal
philosophies led me to question the nature of life.

If I could replace yeast with a single chemical or mixture of a few
chemicals that were capable of converting wort to beer, would that
mixture be alive? By most definitions, probably not, but what then makes
yeast alive? Is it perhaps that yeast separates its innards from the
outer world? What if I made membrane bubbles filled with wort-to-beer
chemicals that let reactants in and products out, would that be alive?
Perhaps it's self-replication that makes yeast alive? What if I put
nano-machines in the membrane bubble that were capable of duplicating
themselves and the chemicals in the bubble as well as increasing the
bubble size and splitting it in half? Now we've probably stepped well
past the gray area and have either made something that is either alive
or nearly impossible to distinguish from something alive.

What if we extend our self-replicating ethanol bubble notion? Would a
self-replicating mining robot be alive? Are computer worms alive? Is a
lathe that can be used to make more lathes like a virus in being almost
alive, save for its need of host (lathe operator)? If I write a piece of
software that simulates yeast at an atomic level, is that piece of
software alive?

Of course, already following `pathetic and weakly emergent
hylopathism <link://slug/dinosaur-comics-helped-me-find-my-philosophy>`__,
I'm of the opinion that every example I've given, from enzyme to yeast,
from lathe to myself, is alive. My hylopathic view of aliveness,
however, is quite at home coexisting with conceptions of other people's
definitions of aliveness in my head. I find that allowing contradictory
and, possibly, mutually exclusive
`memes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme>`__ to live side by side in my
head makes for some very interesting philosophizing and internal
dialogs.

I'm wondering though, Internet, where do you draw your lines? What makes
something alive?
