I've been drinking a lot of vanilla milkshakes recently. So we're clear,
I'm from New England and I'm not talking about
`frappes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frappe>`__. My vanilla milkshake
recipe is very simple, very quick to make and very good:

-   glass cold milk
-   couple or few teaspoons sugar
-   tablespoon or so of vanilla extract

Stir ingredients with a spoon. Drink.

One central element of the recipe is that precision is not important;
sometimes I completely leave out the sugar. Another thing worth noting
is that while real vanilla extract is fairly expensive, artificial
vanilla is really cheap, especially if you get it somewhere like CostCo.
Do not dismay at using artificial components,
`vanillin <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanillin>`__ is incredibly easy
to synthesize with no loss of flavor. I find it to be an incredibly
tasty beverage, in addition to being good for you (it *is* milk) and
easy to make.

Enjoy.
