It's the 4\ :sup:`th` of January in a new year and, if you've followed
me this far, you `might recall <link://slug/the-magical-anniversary>`__
that this is the
`anniversary <link://slug/second-needless-banter-anniversary>`__ of
gwax's rumblings' `fp <link://slug/fp>`__ (first post). Although it's
been a slow year and I've gotten pretty lazy about updating regularly,
I've been doing this for four years and I'm not planning to stop just
yet. Speaking of anniversaries, you might `recall the
sychronicity <link://slug/more-birfdays>`__ of my blog sharing a
birthday with `Uncyclopedia <http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Main_Page>`__,
which just turned three.
