I spent this past weekend in Seattle at `Penny Arcade Expo
2008 <http://www.pennyarcadeexpo.com/>`__, which is a great big
convention for gamers of all sorts and those of similar persuasions. I
met up with Riad, Gautham and Ariel in Seattle and we had an awesome
time. Between the exhibit hall, the panels, the talks, the tournaments,
the freeplay areas and all of the other people, PAX was three solid days
of fun. I highly recommend PAX, in the future, to anyone with any
interest in video games, board games, the Internet or good times in
general.

For me, the major highlights of PAX were:

-   `Monsterpocalypse <http://www.monsterpocalypsegame.com/>`__ -
    Privateer Press was selling preview releases of their new game,
    Monsterpocalypse. Monsterpocalypse is a collectible miniatures game
    focused around destroying opposing monsters and cities. It is a very
    well constructed game and a heck of a lot of fun to play; I purchased
    enough for two people to play and I intend to get more when the game
    is actually released in October. I played two games at PAX, one more
    last night and I really like this game. Monsterpocalypse is awesome
    and I highly recommend looking into it.
-   `Starcraft II <http://www.starcraft2.com/>`__ - Blizzard had playable
    demos of Starcraft 2 up and it seems really good. Starcraft 2 seems
    to have kept the feel and gameplay of the original while replacing
    some of the interface annoyances, improving the graphics and adding a
    few more units. I am now really looking forward to Starcraft 2's
    release.
-   `Demigod <http://www.demigodthegame.com/>`__ - I hadn't heard of
    Demigod before PAX but, as one of the random things I saw in the
    exhibit hall, it looks like a lot of fun. I probably won't get
    Demigod because it seems like the sort of game that's best suited to
    multi-player, which I haven't really been in a good situation for
    since undergrad, but if I were looking for a fun multi-player game,
    Demigod would be on my short list.
-   `Minibosses <http://www.minibosses.com/>`__ - The Minibosses, a rock
    band that exclusively plays covers of video game music, were the last
    act at PAX's Saturday night concert. I've seen the Minibosses before
    as they've played Steer Roast a couple of times but they're still
    great. There is something particularly awesome about hearing the
    theme song to Ninja Gaiden, Megaman 2 or Metroid played on electric
    guitars, bass and drums. The Minibosses played a ~2 hour set that was
    solid glory and totally worth staying up until 3AM for.
-   `MC Frontalot <http://frontalot.com/>`__ - MC Frontalot is probably
    the best known and most popular `nerdcore hip
    hop <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerdcore_hip_hop>`__ artist.
    Frontalot is pretty good and an awful lot of fun. He puts on a great
    show and his raps are really entertaining and well targeted at the
    audience. Heck, Frontalot is probably responsible for making nerdcore
    what it is today.
-   Pitch Your Game Idea - We pitched the oft-discussed in Fort Awesome
    game idea for Eco-Slayer, which met with mass audience approval but
    didn't win any prizes with the panel. The reactions and getting an
    honorable mention from three of the four judges was pretty great.
    Shout outs to Mar, whose idea Eco-Slayer was originally.
-   DTS - PAX had this wonderful system called the Distributed Tournament
    System; basically they gave you two pins at the beginning of PAX to
    wear. If you were wearing at least one DTS pin and saw someone else
    wearing at least one DTS pin, you could challenge them for a pin. The
    challenge could take any form you wanted, in previous years it was
    only for handheld gaming, and the goal was to collect the most pins
    at PAX. I didn't really collect as many as I should have but I had an
    awful lot of thumb wars, Indian wrestling contests and games of
    rock-paper-scissors. DTS made for a great way to interact with and
    meet random new people, even if it was just for a short competition
    and conversation. Seriously though, I had some truly epic thumb wars,
    one even ended in a draw after about 15 minutes of fierce
    competition.
-   Other people - One of the best things about PAX was all the other
    people. Sure there were some annoying socially awkward people but
    there were also a lot of really cool people. It was a great big
    convention for people that like some of the things that I like and
    for which I, as a person, probably fell within one standard deviation
    of normal. It was a nice feeling being surrounded, in a sense, by my
    peoples.
