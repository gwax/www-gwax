I've been irked at President-elect Obama since he voted in favor of
`FISA <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Act_of_1978_Amendments_Act_of_2008>`__
but now I hear that he might `kill daylight savings
time <http://www.greendaily.com/2008/11/21/obama-looks-to-axe-daylight-time-nyt-explains-why/>`__.
Now, you may recall that I `passionately loath daylight savings
time <link://slug/abolish-daylight-savings-time>`__ and abolishing it
would shift Mr. Obama closer to my good side. Mind you, not screwing
with my time twice a year does not quite make up for giving away my
rights but it is a small step in the right direction.
