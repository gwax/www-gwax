|Wizards poster| `Ralph
Bakshi <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Bakshi>`__ is a particularly
interesting American maker of animated films. I expect relatively few of
you have ever heard of Ralph Bakshi and almost as few have seen any of
his works, which is why it is necessary that I bring Ralph and his works
to your attention.

My first encounter with Ralph Bakshi came when, at a young age, I saw
the box for his 1977 film
`Wizards <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizards_%28film%29>`__ at my
local video rental location, Video Revolution, and thought that it
looked phenomenally cool (same image as the poster image to the right).
For reasons I do not recall, I didn't manage to actually watch Wizards
until I was in high school and, let me tell you, it's a pretty fantastic
movie. Wizards is set in the far, far, post-post-apocalyptic future and
tells the story of a war between two wizard brothers, Avatar and
Blackwolf of the land of good and evil respectively. If I recall
correctly, the war is precipitated by Blackwolf's discovery of ancient
Nazi war propaganda. The film does a fantastic job of alternating
between light, dark and flat out surreal; I highly recommend it.

It wasn't until just recently that, in deciding to hunt down a copy of
Wizards, I learned the identity of Ralph Bakshi. Being the obsessive
consumer of media that I am, I decided to see what else Ralph has done
and, lo and behold, Ralph Bakshi was responsible for `Cool
World <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_World>`__. Cool World was a
rather odd mix of cartoons and live action that I am rather fond of in
spite of the rather poor critical acclaim that it garnered in its time;
I must be a member of the cult for which it is a cult hit. Upon
realizing that Ralph was responsible for Wizards and Cool World, it
became necessary for me to track down his other works and what should
turn out to be his seminal work? None other than the film version of
`Fritz the
Cat <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_the_Cat_%28film%29>`__. Fritz
the Cat is noteworthy both as the first independent animated film to
gross more than $100 million in the box office and as the first X-rated
animated feature film. `R.
Crumb <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Crumb>`__ did not like
Bakshi's take on Fritz the Cat and killed off the comic character in
retaliation but, by most accounts, R. Crumb is a whack-job and the film
was great; I have obtained the film but have not yet had the chance to
watch it so I must withhold my personal views for now.

Ralph Bakshi is one of the behemoths of mid-20\ :sup:`th` century
animation, responsible for many things beyond the few that I have
mentioned, and I would be doing you a disservice if I didn't bring him
to your attention. Having done so, the disservice of not watching
Bakshi's works is now yours to remedy.
