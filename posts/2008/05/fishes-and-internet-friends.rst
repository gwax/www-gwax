Back in late 2002, there was a great Internet phenomenon known to many
as the `Star Wars kid <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_kid>`__.
As some of you may recall, I was one of the first people on the Internet
to find the Star Wars kid video; I decided to host the video on my web
server, ozone-beast at that time--God rest that wonderful ozone spewing
hulk of a computronium--and sent an e-mail out to random-hall-talk
announcing its presences. Within a few days, ozone beast was being
deluged with hits from all over the world. I also happened to receive an
IM correspondence from a girl in Bakersfield, CA. Being a sophomore at
the time and having way too much free time, I struck up a
correspondence. McKenzie and I have since maintained an Internet
friendship without ever having met in person.

After moving to the Bay Area, I had been planning to drive down
California a bunch, meet Kenzie, visit people in LA and do the whole
SoCal thing but then, as you may
`recall <link://slug/and-now-a-five-car-pile-up>`__,
I ceased to have a car. This week, however, Kenzie was in Monterey with
her boyfriend, who had business; Monterey being reasonably close by
California standards, I grabbed a Zipcar, ditched out of work early and
drove down to say hi. We went to the Monterey Aquarium, which is
fantastic by the way, hung out for a few hours and had a generally good
time.

It's a rather interesting thing to meet in person someone that you've
gotten to know through other means. The meeting and the hang out were
surprisingly not awkward, though I've always felt that the best way to
avoid awkwardness is to just not act awkward. Sure it was a lot of
driving but it was very nice driving, the Monterey Aquarium really is
great and it is really great to finally meet someone that you've known
for over five years.
