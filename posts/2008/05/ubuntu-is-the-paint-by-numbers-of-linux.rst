I was talking with my brother, who is not a computer geek, and
discussing variations on Linux when he came up with an amazing analogy
that was so brilliant I had to share it with the rest of you. He said,
"I guess it would be more like a blank piece of paper versus a color by
numbers thing". It's exactly spot on, Ubuntu is the paint-by-numbers of
Linux; it's really easy to do the stuff it's aimed at doing but going
outside the lines doesn't look as good as if you'd used a more general
option. Of course, while you Ubuntu users are all kindergartners, I'm
busy ricing out my machines with Gentoo; I don't actually know which is
a worse thing to be analogized to.
