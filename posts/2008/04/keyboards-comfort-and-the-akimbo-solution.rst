I've always been rather fond of trying new things that twist the way I
think about and interact with things and computers are no exception.
Ever since I used `The Typing of the
Dead <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Typing_of_the_Dead>`__ to learn
how to touch type, I have taken an interest in keyboard layouts and
designs and the more time I spend typing in my life, the more I come to
understand the effects of typing comfort compounded over time. Prior to
2001, I was a dedicated 2-4 finger typist, capable of achieving over
30-40wpm using what amounted to "hunt and peck" without the hunting; it
was essentially a successive offsetting solution using memorized
relative positions to guide my hands. Then, in 2001, I built my beloved
thevoid and got a `Microsoft Natural Keyboard
Pro <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Natural_keyboard>`__ because
it looked cool, had a USB hub and some neat programmable function
buttons. The Natural keyboard has the fairly standard split keyboard
layout, which completely broke my relative position scheme--the gap in
the middle prevented cross-overs, which were integral to the scheme. At
that point I slowly began learning how to touch type but later in the
year, I discovered `The Typing of the
Dead <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Typing_of_the_Dead>`__ and that
changed everything; in addition to making speed typing a game, it also
included a very useful typing tutor.

Having learned proper touch typing, I had divorced myself from
cross-overs and was able to enjoy the comfort provided by a split
keyboard. Additionally, at this time, I was living in a dormitory with
my good friend, `Riad <http://blog.jfet.org/>`__, who swears by `Kinesis
ergonomic
keyboards <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinesis_%28keyboard%29>`__,
which I must agree are really comfortable. The Kinesis keyboard is
probably the most comfortable and ergonomic keyboard solution that I had
encountered prior to the Jerry-rigged solution that I've just devised
(see below). The Kinesis keyboards, however, have the huge disadvantage
of being really expensive.

From there, my keyboard experiments languished for a number of years
until one day, when I was bored, I put lettered stickers on thevoid's
keyboard keys and switched the layout to a
`Dvorak <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard>`__
layout. Learning Dvorak was not entirely painless and I eventually gave
it up because the positions of the '[/{' and ']/}' keys made C/C++
programming inconvenient--this later turned out to be because I didn't
full learn to touch-type Dvorak. I have switched to Dvorak and back
probably half a dozen times since, getting better each time; sometimes
using Dvorak and QWERTY concurrently on different machines. At this
point, I can switch between Dvorak and QWERTY with ease and I can say,
without reservation, that Dvorak is much easier, faster and more
comfortable than QWERTY. At present, I am using QWERTY because some of
my keyboards are not suited to Dvorak layouts and it makes my new
configuration more practical.

Recently, I've started to notice more so than before, how very
uncomfortable it is to touch-type on an unsplit keyboard; the arm and
wrist contortion is terrible. I was thinking that I might do well to ask
the IT department at work if I could get a split keyboard but I'm much
more the type to improvise an elaborate solution than walk 100 feet and
ask someone for something. I asked myself what the ideal layout would be
and decided that a split keyboard solves the wrist contortion but it
still requires the arms to be uncomfortably tight in to the body. The
solution: two keyboards, one 45° left, one 45° right, mouse in the
center; each hand uses half a keyboard and it turns out to be really
comfortable. If I want to adjust how one hand rests, I only need to
adjust that one keyboard. Sure it takes a lot of desk space but I have
that in spades right now and it really complements my multi-monitor
setup. This is my akimbo solution and I really like it; if you know how
to touch-type, have the desk space and a spare keyboard, I highly
recommend giving it a try. Having just checked with a small online test,
I am averaging about 60wpm and 96% accuracy with my keyboards akimbo
layout.

Also, just so we're clear, I do know that
`akimbo <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akimbo>`__ is etymologically
incorrect but it is a linguistic mutation that I approve of.
