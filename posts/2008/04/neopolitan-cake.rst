I did make a three-layered (vanilla/strawberry/chocolate) cake but
that's not really what I want to talk about; I'm only referencing it in
the title and beginning of this post to spite Hippo, who condescendingly
suggested I blog about my cake. I'd far rather talk about the party I
threw Sunday in honor of my recent birthday.

I can say, without reservation, that this was one of the best birthday
parties that I can remember and it was all thanks to the people. The
turn out was spectacular, including college friends, high school friends
I haven't seen in years, co-worker friends and friends-of-friends (some
of whom I had not previously met). The party was set to kick off at 3pm,
with snacks, beers and eventual barbecuing but people didn't start
showing up until nearly 4pm. For a short while, the turnout seemed like
it might be a bit low but then we must have hit the fashionably late
turning point and it turned into quite the social gathering, peaking at
around 20-25 people. People were still showing up well into the evening
and it didn't start to dwindle much until about 10pm or 11pm. I can't
quite say that it went off without a hitch as there were certainly some
issues but everything went well in the end.

It was a great party, everything that I had hoped, and my thanks go out
to everyone who showed up.
