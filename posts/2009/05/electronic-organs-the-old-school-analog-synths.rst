impulses and ridiculosity are both things that are fundamental to my
being, I purchased, off of the craigslistnettertubes, an electronic
organ. Most specifically, I purchased, for my apartment place-thing, a
used Conn 580 manual organ. There was a wonderful alcove in our
apartment that was the perfect size for an upright piano or similar; I
was browsing the interwebworknettubes and went to the
craigslisternettertubewebworks and happened to find this wonderful organ
for sale. To my advantage, the man I bought the organ from was nice
enough to deliver it to our apartment. Of course, hauling the organ up
two flights of stairs was quite a hastle but it's here now and it's not
moving again for a very long time.

most other electronic organs, is a complex device composed of gobs and
gobs of analog electronics. It would be accurate to describe the device
as an early analog synthesizer. Amongst the many other awesome things
about this organ, the top can be flipped up exposing the crazy mass of
wires, oscillators and other circuit craziness. The number of switches,
buttons, keys, and such on this organ is rather mind-boggling and I'm
only starting to figure out what half of the stuff does. That said, I've
been pretty successful at tossing out some pretty awesome sounds without
knowing what I'm doing.

With luck, having a keyboard in the house with provide me sufficient
impetus to get around to relearning how to play a keyboard. I feel like
I want to get back to knowing how to play the piano (or, in this case,
organ). Failing that, though, I've got the potential to make some pretty
fun sounds.
