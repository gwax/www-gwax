I finally got around to watching the end of Battlestar Galactica (sure
took me long enough) and I have to say that I was somewhat displeased,
to say the least. Don't get me wrong; the series, as a whole, was quite
pleasant and I did enjoy watching the end but, still, somewhat
displeased.

SPOILERS FOLLOW:

Points of contention:

-  Luddism: We had lots of technology and lots of war so let's throw
   away all of our technology. Seriously? Going one step further; you
   think that you can actually just throw away all of your knowledge.
   It'd be zero to super-polymers age in one day. Oh, le sigh.
-  Religion: God this, destiny that, magical know-how the other; ugh,
   give me a break.
-  Starbuck: What's the deal with her? Just going to write her out with
   no explanation at all? Talk about sloppy. Talk about cop-out.
-  Prehistory: If that's supposed to be Earth, how do you explain
   linguistic evolution? Where are the records of ships and technology?
   What about the super fancy materials? I bet they didn't degrade in
   the past 150 thousand years.
-  Matrix Architect: Didn't we get the this has happened a bunch of
   times before idea out of the way in The Matrix Reloaded? It was a
   so-so idea then and it's even more so now.
-  etc.: Those were the big ones, at least.

Seriously, you guys couldn't come up with a better way to write a
conclusion to this thing? I guess mediocre closure is still better than
no closure. Thanks for the four/five seasons of pretty great, Battlestar
Galactica. Oh well, time to catch up on Lie to Me and Dollhouse, I
guess.
