Arising from a nap taken while sprawling across three seats on MX976
from Guadalajara to San Francisco, I am reminded of a desire to comment
on the so-called swine flu. Of the five flights taken during my trip,
none have been at capacity and two have provided me with full rows for
myself. The true utilization is in stark contrast with the near full
planes that were described when I purchased my tickets; I understand
Mexicana was allowing refunds of some sort on account of the flu.

Cancun was, I have been led to understand, empty relative to other years
at this time. The resort at which I stayed was likely at no more than
30% occupancy; near full capacity is the norm. Other resorts and hotels
were closed due to a lack of guests. This, of course, meant that we
largely had the resort to ourselves but, selfishness aside, it also
means that the local economy is suffering an absolutely horrible
collapse and any locals without sufficient savings may need to seek
other work. Compounding with the general global downturn, there will
likely be a profoundly negative effect on Cancun and other Mexican
resort areas.

The response of the Mexican government is rather interesting as well.
The government had health checkpoints set up at airports and state
borders. Individuals are required to fill out a questionnaire as to
whether or not they are suffering any flu symptoms and then have their
temperature checked by thermal camera or infrared probe; neither of
which I suspect is particularly accurate. What they would do to one who
fails such testing is unclear as they did not seem set up for any sort
of quarantine. Furthermore, a few Tylenol, aspirin and lies ought to be
enough to get anyone through. The whole exercise reeks of security
theater, a topic which I fear raising lest I rant far beyond your
patience.
