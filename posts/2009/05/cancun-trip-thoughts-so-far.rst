Today is Wednesday of my Sunday through Saturday week in Cancun. It is
currently the evening, about 11p and, before I go to sleep in
preparation for tomorrow's activities, I thought that I should check-in
with y'all. I think that I'm going to structure this as a summary of some
of what's been going on and follow with some more general thoughts that
have been crystallizing.

It being Cancun, the obligatory sun bathing, swimming and strong, frozen
beverages have been happening but, as that is largely not interesting in
any detail, I'll leave it at that. I have been staying with friends at
the Royal Sands, a timeshare resort. This is one of five timeshare
resorts owned by this company and I have to say, it's pretty sweet;
honestly, if my family didn't have property on Cape Cod, I would
strongly consider signing in to this whole timeshare thing. The
amenities are nice, the weather is fantastic and, let me tell you, the
water is amazing. Evenings here have primarily finished off with games
of Dominos, Fluxx and Set,which has been a wholly pleasant experience,
and makes me want to play more casual games with friends.

This morning, we traveled to the Mayan ruins at Chichen Itza, which were
truly fantastic to see. The degree of engineering, architectural and
astronomical knowledge expressed by the structures of the ruins is truly
impressive. I am certain that the experience was greatly enhanced by the
quality and character of our tour guide. One of the major things that
caught root in my mind as a result of the experience is the impermanence
of everything that I am doing with my life. Even a relatively modest
Mayan dwelling still exists and expresses something about its
inhabitants; what mark have I left on this world that will not be gone
two generations from now? For that matter, what mark am I really leaving
now?

Certain, deeper things seem to be gaining focus for me as well. One that
seems truly clear is the degree to which I have missed the Atlantic
Ocean and Woods Hole. Hopefully, my plans to work remotely from Woods
Hole this summer will succeed and I shall get some substantial time
there.

Another thing that occurs to me is that I need to spend more time with
my good friends and, perhaps, make a few more.
