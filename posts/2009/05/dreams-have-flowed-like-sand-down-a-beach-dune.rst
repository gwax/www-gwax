Something that I have been acutely noticing is that I have had extremely
vivid dreams every time that I have slept or napped. The dreams have
been vivid to a degree that might be described as bordering on
hallucination. I suspect that the dreams have been present on account of
the adequacy of the sleep that I have been receiving. I am inclined,
however, to attribute the vividness to the potency and desiccation of the
sun and heat. It is, perhaps, as if I had ventured into the desert to
undertake a vision quest of sorts.

I am enjoying this dreaming to an extent that strongly suggests the
adoption of a decent sleep regimen.
