Having just finished Heretics of Dune, I am, once again, wowed by Frank
Herbert's skill as an author. There exist very powerful thoughts within
his writing that seem to plant themselves in the psyche as Leto II
planted himself in the worms of Rakis. As I sit here, I can't help but
react with a desire to better myself mentally, physically and socially.
I feel as though this is a moment of opening and from here my choices
are to pass through into the chapel perilous or step back, allowing the
doors to close.

As to which path I shall take, I cannot say but it is my great hope that
I will have the strength to push forward.
