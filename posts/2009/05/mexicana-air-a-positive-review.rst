As I write, I am sitting in seat 20E on a Mexicana Airbus A318 en route
from San Francisco to Mexico City. It is 9:30a; I am writing on my Nokia
N810 (a device, which I will have to tell you of some other time); I
have just consumed a wholly decent omelette; and, I it is my intention
to publish this as soon as I next encounter Internet access. The
omelette has arrested my attention and is what prompted this post.

Though the omelette fell somewhere between edible and passable, this
really is more of a "thought that counts" sort of thing. I have become
so accustomed to the nickel-and-diming of bankrupt United States
airlines that I was astonished to be offered food: "omelette or
enchilada?" It took me two tries to understand through the Mexican
accent, but that's probably a failing on my part. Not only is there food
but there appears to be free beer, though, it being 9:30a, I opted for
milk.

Based on my experience thus far, I'm liking Mexicana and feeling
reminiscent of British Airways. If you're reading this, as is, nothing
has interfered with my opinion sufficiently to justify revision.
