Took me a bit of doing but I've updated my old theme to work with the
latest version of Wordpress. Most of the effort and time was taken up
because I decided to do it in as much the, so to speak, right way as
possible.

Other than changing two lines of functions.php, everything is
accomplished using CSS.

If you want it, you can `grab my theme <link:///gwax.zip>`__.
