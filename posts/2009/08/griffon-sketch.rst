    A sketch of a griffin standing in watch over a savanna

This is further art sketched on my N810 while idle in life. I've always found
griffins (which I apparently can't always spell correctly) to be fantastically
cool mythical beasts, right up there with hydras, I'd say. This image is
of a griffin up on high observing its savanna hunting grounds. I kind of
feel like griffins, were they to exist, would have been native to
Africa; you could say that my landscape in this image has African
savanna influences (ish).
