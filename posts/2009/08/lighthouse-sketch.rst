    Sketch of a landscape with lighthouse made on my N810

Another image from the department of sketches that
I've made on my N810 while passing time \*cough*in meetings*cough*.
This, as should likely be obvious, is a sketch of a lighthouse on a
cliff above some rocky waters near some relatively peaceful ocean
waters. Enjoy.
