Thanks to hunch, I recently discovered the anime `Tengen Toppa Gurren
Lagann <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurren_Lagann>`__, or just
*Gurren Lagann*, which I have really been enjoying.

Gurren Lagann is, at its heart, a mecha anime and, as anyone who knows
my love of Transformers and Battletech will understand, that is a plus
in my book. The art is great and the battle scenes are just awesome. On
top of that, there are some pretty great characters in the show; I am
especially fond of Kamina. Also, Gurren Lagann has already run its full
27 episode course, which means that I can watch it and enjoy a degree of
completion, which is a thing that I really enjoy being able to do.

As far as anime series go, Gurren Lagann is the first one that I've seen
and really enjoyed since Trigun. I wouldn't say that Gurren Lagann is
not Samurai Champloo caliber but it's certainly worth hunting down and
giving a shot.
