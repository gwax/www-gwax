Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (Transformers 2) is not what one
would refer to as a good movie in the sense that Forrest Gump or Seven
Samurai might be considered good. Transformers 2 is, however, an awesome
movie in the sense that summer blockbusters are designed to be awesome.
It's pretty typical to see a movie that's got crazy effects and action
but with a story/plot that mostly exists to give pause and glue to hold
things together, which is somewhat farcical, in my opinion.

The logical conclusion to the trend of summer blockbusters is that
story/plot isn't actually that important and, if done wrong, can really
drag a movie down. So, what happens if you reach that logical conclusion
and make a movie that is an open acknowledgment of the frivolity of plot
in summer blockbusters? You end up with something that is a gorgeous,
shiny, moving piece of art, that pleases your senses but not your
intellectualism; you end up with something that every traditional
movie-watcher will think is terrible as they hunt for plot and a, so to
speak, good movie.

This is the case for Transformers 2. Critics, in looking for plot and
traditional quality, have failed to see the gorgeous, shiny,
sense-satiating, monster of an experience that Transformers 2 is. The
critics made a similar experience with Speed Racer, which was not very
compelling but nonetheless excessively beautiful.

In addition to the amazing experience that Transformers 2 is, its
quality has also inspired, what is probably the finest review of
anything, ever. `io9 <http://io9.com/>`__ puts it quite well in their
review, `Michael Bay Finally Made An Art
Movie <http://io9.com/5301898/michael-bay-finally-made-an-art-movie>`__,
which I completely agree with. Excerpt below:

    Transformers: ROTF has mostly gotten pretty hideous reviews, but
    that's because people don't understand that this isn't a movie, in
    the conventional sense. It's an assault on the senses, a barrage of
    crazy imagery. Imagine that you went back in time to the late 1960s
    and found Terry Gilliam, fresh from doing his weird low-fi
    collage/animations for Monty Python. You proceeded to inject Gilliam
    with so many steroids his penis shrank to the size of a hair
    follicle, and you smushed a dozen tabs of LSD under his tongue. And
    then you gave him the GDP of a few sub-Saharan countries. Gilliam
    might have made a movie not unlike this one.

In short, read this review; ignore the other reviews; go see
Transformers 2; get overstimulated; and enjoy the culmination of all
that is the summer blockbuster.
