I saw `Avatar <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_%282009_film%29>`__
last night in RealD 3D and, I have to say, it is a very pretty, rather
fun, awesome to watch movie. The 3D for *Avatar* was incredibly well
done but it gave me such a bad headache and nausea that it almost wasn't
worth it. Luckily, I was able to immediately go home and go to sleep,
thus not dealing with the discomfort much. Needless to say, I think that
I'm going to stick to 2D movies for the foreseeable future.

Diatribe about 3D aside, *Avatar* is a pretty great movie. Sure it's
`Dances with Wolves <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dances_with_Wolves>`__
in space but *Dances with Wolves* was a good movie so why not put it in
space. Actually, more than that, to me *Avatar* was *Dances with Wolves*
meets `Dinotopia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinotopia>`__ in space.
The color palettes of *Avatar* were vibrant and pretty in much the way
that the palettes of *Dinotopia* were; furthermore, the creatures and
world were sufficiently realized to make it seem like a place that one
might really want to go. In fact, I think *Avatar* has provided me with
the first artificial setting that I have had a strong desire to visit
since *Dinotopia*.

So, having discussed the pain (literally) of the 3D, the adequacy of the
story (adequate being the right word), and the beauty of the world,
let's talk about the special effects. For quite a while, I have been
adamantly opposed to the use and overuse of
`CGI <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_generated_imagery>`__ in the
film industry. Certainly, some studios do CGI correctly (Pixar,
DreamWorks) but when mixed with live action, I tend to think that the
`Jurassic
Park <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_%28film%29>`__ or
`Aliens <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_%28film%29>`__ approach of
relying primarily on live action, puppets and robots is a much safer and
more visually appealing approach. The clearest example of where real is
good and CGI is bad is to look at the original *Star Wars* trilogy in
comparison to the new *Star Wars* trilogy. Somehow, thankfully, James
Cameron has not fallen in the same way that George Lucas has; Avatar
beautifully mixes the real with the CGI and I did not once feel as
though things had fallen into the `uncanny
valley <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley>`__.

Hopefully *Avatar* will end up profitable in spite of its truly
ludicrous budget (officially $237M + $150M marketing) and James Cameron
will be allowed to keep making crazy as heck science fiction stuff (it
was at >$232M after its opening weekend so odds are pretty good). The
outstanding question now is whether he's going to make a sequel to
*Avatar* or whether he's going to make `Battle Angel
Alita <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Angel_Alita>`__ like he's
been talking about for a while.

So yeah, overall, I am inclined to recommend the *Dances with Wolves*
meets *Dinotopia* in space movie, otherwise known as *Avatar* but I do
not recommend it in 3D unless you've got some Dramamine to take
beforehand. Actually, that's an idea; maybe I'll pop a couple Dramamine
and try seeing it again, you know, for science.
