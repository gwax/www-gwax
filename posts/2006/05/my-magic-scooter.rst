Ok kiddies, random bizarro dream time:

<dream>

    I spent an awful lot of time riding around on my magic scooter. I
    remember being in Cambridge mostly, riding from place to place, visiting
    with various friends and having a jolly good time. The portion that I
    recall most vividly was riding along the Fresh Pond Parkway from
    Memorial Drive to Route 2. I remember stopping at the light where the
    Fresh Pond Parkway crosses Huron Avenue and passing a truck to be the
    first one to the halfway point of the intersection. Of course, the
    details really aren't very important, the point is I had a scooter and I
    was having a jolly good time riding around on it.

    Now, my scooter was in no way an ordinary scooter, it was a magical
    scooter (possibly in a `Clarke's third
    law <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws>`__ sense). To
    explain how the scooter was special, I want you to start by thinking
    about a generic scooter, like a Vespa or such, that's pretty much how my
    magic scooter worked. Now, despite working a lot like any other scooter,
    my magic scooter was more like a pair of shoes than an ordinary scooter;
    basically, I just had to stand with my feet in a line, one in front of
    the other, sit down a bit, grasp imaginary handle bars and go. My
    scooter was magic in so far as it wasn't even there.

I know it's not all that interesting a story but think about it from the
conceptual level; how awesome would it be to have a scooter built into
your shoes. I wonder if someone could manufacture such an interface;
boots with pop out wheels and tiny motors with wireless connections to
special control gloves.
