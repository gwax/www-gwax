I recently came across the trailer for Al Gore's new movie about global
warming, `An Inconvenient Truth <http://climatecrisis.com/>`__, so I
figured that I might as well watch it and see what's up. The trailer on
it's own has completely changed my views on global warming but probably
not for the better. There was one particular scene where they were
showing what would happen to various coastlines if the South Pole melted
causing sea level to rise twenty feet and I had the instant thought that
when ("if" if you want to be an optimist) global warming really kicks
in, I'll have to get a bigger boat. Seriously, if there's apocalyptic
flooding, I'll just pull a Kevin Costner in Waterworld, except without
the gills, nautical inaccuracies or that whole pariah thing.

Somehow, I think the point was to get me to be scared and start fighting
against global warming not get me to think about boats. Oops.
