Today, two of my teeth migrated from in my mouth to out of my mouth. In
other words, I got my remaining two wisdom teeth yanked. Between being a
pack rat and not liking to lose parts of myself, I obviously kept the
teeth. I must say, teeth are pretty keen little things, structurally and
aesthetically; heck, I can totally understand the appeal of a necklace
of teeth, especially molars. Ooh, I like this, if anyone out there is
getting or has had their wisdom teeth pulled and doesn't really want the
teeth, please send or give them to me; if I get enough teeth, I'll make
a necklace and I promise you that I'll wear it.

If you would like to donate your teeth to my cause, leave a message
here, e-mail me, IM me, hand them to me or mail them to me (relevant
contact information can be found on my
`homepage <https://www.gwax.com/>`__. I promise that it'll be a nice
necklace too, I'd probably spring for a nice gold or silver chain to
hold the teeth together.
