This just in from the because why not department, I'm converting my
keyboards to and teaching myself to use the Dvorak keyboard layout.
Supposedly Dvorak is faster and loss likely to cause carpal tunnel but
I'm not trying it for those reasons; I'm trying Dvorak because it fits
into my ongoing policy of cultivating eccentricities quite well.

So far, it's mostly just annoying not knowing how to type anymore but,
even so, I'm starting to get the hang of some of the vowels and more
commonly used keys. Aside from my eccentricity goals, I'm inclined to
believe that there might just be something to this crazy layout. That
said, I do have one big complaint already, I can't use a mouse with my
right hamd and press Ctrl-X/C/V with my left hand on its home row.
