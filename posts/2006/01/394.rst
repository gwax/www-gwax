Having begun the process of actually doing application things, I have
revised the list of schools to which I am applying. The list, in an
arbitrary order, is as follows:

-  University of California, Berkeley
-  University of California, Los Angeles
-  University of Chicago
-  University of Minnesota
-  New York University
-  Northwestern
-  Yale

That is the finalized list, I will be writing essays and completing
applications in the next few days.
