my brand new acer 20.1" inch TFT seems to have 2 very strange pixels,
one small red one and a bigger brighter purple. I've run some mp4 video
with the same stuff as the gif image and it's managed to fix the red one
after just a few minutes but the purple one is still beeing worked on.
it's strange how its not visible when there is white imagery.
