Right now, this blog is about half an hour away from two years since
`fp <link://slug/fp>`_ (first post). Happy two years putting up with
my yammering, Internet. To commemorate the occasion, I've found this
fantastically keen plugin that generates an image showing what time of
day I post. I've decided to set it to report over the past 351 days, for
obvious reasons. The graph is displayed here and should also appear at
the bottom of pages.
