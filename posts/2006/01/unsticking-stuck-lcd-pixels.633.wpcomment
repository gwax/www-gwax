You are a legend! The first time i turned on my new notebook i
discovered a pixel permanently white! I had a headache from abusing
people at Acer Support Line so i tried your little program. About ten
seconds of strobing funky colours and circular massaging later and... hey
presto... one fully functioning pixel. Thanks
