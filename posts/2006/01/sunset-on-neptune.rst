I've invented a new cocktail, which I've decided to call the Sunset on
Neptune because it's blue, red and pretty. The drink looks different
depending on what direction you look at it from and your lighting
conditions, ranging from light blue, to deep violet, to dark red. In
addition to its fantastic aesthetic qualities, the Sunset on Neptune is
a very tasty and fairly alcoholic orange/grenadine flavored beverage.
The ingredients are as follows and there are a few different ways to
make it: (all quantities are approximate and should be varied to
personal tastes)

-   1 part Vodka
-   1 part Blue Curacao
-   2 parts orange juice soda (Polar Orange Dry, Orangina, or the like;
    not orange soda)
-   1/2 part Grenadine

Take a glass full of ice (preferably large cubes) and pour in the vodka.
Add the orange juice soda and stir. Add the Blue Curacao to the mixture;
now if you stir, the mixture will be blue, but it you don't there will
be a thin green/orange layer on top with a slightly different flavor.
Now, slowly pour the Grenadine into the mixture; if you stir now, the
drink will be purple but, if you don't stir, you will have a red layer
at the bottom and a blue layer on top. If you decide not to stir the
Curacao or Grenadine layers, you'll get a really neat
red/violet/blue/green/orange/etc. thing going with a nice flavor
gradient as well. Overall, I'm fantastically pleased with the concoction
and would love to hear feedback from other people.

Also, I'm going to go out on a limb and speculate that the same thing
can be done with orange juice instead of orange juice soda and I'm going
to go ahead and coin that Neptune's Screwdriver.

Oh, and if you've got a better name, I'm not married to Sunset on
Neptune.
