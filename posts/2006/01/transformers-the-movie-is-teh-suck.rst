Transformers: The Movie came up in conversation at work and one of my
coworkers forwarded me a link to a `rant about how much the movie
sucks <http://www.outpostnine.com/editorials/source.html>`__. I love
that movie and I was expecting a stupid read that I would thoroughly
disagree with, but instead I find myself agreeing with everything said.
The rant is absolutely spot on in pointing out that Transformers: The
Movie sucks and I find no fault in the diatribe; even so, I love the
movie and am going to take passion over rational in this case.
