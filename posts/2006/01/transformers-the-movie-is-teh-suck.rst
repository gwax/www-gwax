Transformers: The Movie came up in conversation at work and one of my
coworkers forwarded me a link to a
`rant about how much the movie sucks
<https://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/transformers/256185/transformers-the-movie-and-the-great-toy-massacre-of-1986>`__.
I love that movie and I was expecting a stupid read that I would thoroughly
disagree with, but instead I find myself agreeing with everything said.
The rant is absolutely spot on in pointing out that Transformers: The
Movie sucks and I find no fault in the diatribe; even so, I love the
movie and am going to take passion over rational in this case.
