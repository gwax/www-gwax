Last night, I received a random telephone call from a number that I did
not recognize and, as is my style, I answered it. My, "Hello" was met
with an, "Is this George Waksman?" to which I responded in the
affirmative, a response that met with much revelry from the other end of
the line. The call eventually turned out to be from some guy who come
across my research into `Tootsie Roll Pops <link://slug/tootsiepop>`__ and
taken advantage of the fact that I keep my cell phone number on `my
homepage <https://www.gwax.com>`__. This man was calling because he
wanted to know both if I was serious and if I had really eaten all those
Tootsie Roll Pops. Not being a lying sort of person, I of course
informed the gentleman that I was only kind of serious but that I had in
fact eaten all of those Tootsie Roll Pops. The man on the telephone
seemed overjoyed by the information that I had just provided him,
thanked me and took his leave of the telephone conversation.
