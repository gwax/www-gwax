Joy of wondrous joys, my vision has decided to pack its bags and take
off for an indefinite vacation. It turns out that I have inherited my
mother's astigmatism as well as having suffered general temporally based
degradation of my eyes. Sadly, the days when my left eye was 20/8 and my
right eye was 20/12 are gone to be replaced with astigmatism and 20/30
in my left eye and 20/60 in my right eye. On the positive side, I guess,
my left eye is still sufficient to have passed a Minnesota driving test
and the fantastic blueness of my eyes hasn't gone anywhere at all.
Hopefully glasses will make me look sophisticated, sexy or something
else described with a positive adjective.

P.S. Getting old and falling apart sucks.

P.P.S. Isn't 23 too early to start feeling old?
