I guess, in a sense though, this is my Momma's climate but that's not
really the point. Today, October 11th, marks the first time that we've
received snow here in Minneapolis. As I sit here waiting for the feeling
to return to my ears, I wanted to let all of you out there in warmer
climes know what you're missing.
