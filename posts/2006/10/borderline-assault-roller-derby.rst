I went to another roller derby last night and it was even better than
the first one. Last nights derby saw our Minnesota Rollergirls facing
off against the Dairyland Dolls of Madison, Wisconsin. For a number of
reasons, this matchup was substantially more interesting than last
times; specifically, the Dairyland Dolls are a team on par with ours,
whereas the previous encounter was strongly in our favor and Minnesota
has a bit of a rivalry with Wisconsin, a rivalry which I have started
buying into in my time here. I am also developing a more refined
appreciation for the joy that is roller derby. I freely admit that the
reason I went to the first derby was because the idea of chicks on
rollerskates running into each other seemed kind of hot and pretty
awesome but this time around, I actually understand the rules. While
there was still an element of liking that there were a bunch of scantily
clad women roller skating in a full contact manner, I found myself
taking a great deal of interest in matters of defensive and offensive
strategy. I will go so far as to say that last nights match showed me
that Minnesota has a fantastic offense with some really spot on jammers
but our defense leaves a bit to be desired. Wisconsin, on the other
hand, had an absolutely fantastic defense--near impenetrable at
times--but their offense is only so-so. Sadly, our strong offense was
not enough to take the bout and Wisconsin beat us 60-something to
40-something (I can't remember exactly). Everything else included, I
maintain that roller derby is the best spectator sport ever and that you
should all check it out.
