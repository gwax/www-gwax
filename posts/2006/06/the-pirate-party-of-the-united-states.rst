|Pirate Party of the United States Logo| The `Pirate Party of the United
States <http://www.pirate-party.us/>`__ is a newly formed political
party that is derivative of Sweden's
`Piratpartiet <http://www2.piratpartiet.se/the_pirate_party>`__.
Extracted from their website, their platform is as follows:

   "The Pirate Party is a newly formed worldwide political party with a
   chapter in the U.S.. We want to fundamentally reform copyright law,
   overhaul the patent system, and ensure that citizens' rights to
   privacy are respected. With this agenda, and only this, we are making
   a bid for representation in anywhere we can get elected."

Seeing as they stand for the same things that I stand for and their
platform and agendas do a good job of addressing the big issues that
concern me, I think that I might finally have found a reason to stop
being a registered independant. Also, what could be cooler than to be a
registered pirate?
