|Ford Factory Amp| |Ford Factory Amp (open)| Today I tore apart the trim
on the passenger side of my truck, and ripped out the God foresaken
"Premium Audio" factory installed amplifier. The factory amp has long
been the bane of my truck's stereo system for a very long time now. The
number of problems I can blame on that stupid amp are many and I won't
bother enumerating them but now it has been replaced by a by-pass I
bought at Tweeter, which consists of nothing more than 8 wires and a
couple connectors. Now that I've gotten the thing out and my truck's
audio is finally up to par, I've got to figure out what I'm going to do
with this silly amp; I'm not electronically inclined enough to do
anything really interesting, but I'm open to suggestions.

Things sound so much better now; I'm so pleased.
