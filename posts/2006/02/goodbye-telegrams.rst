As of a few days ago STOP Western Union has `stopped supporting Telegram
service <http://www.westernunion.com/info/osTelegram.asp?country=US>`__

STOP This is something that saddens me immensely STOP I always thought
that telegrams were totally awesome STOP I especially liked the whole
ending sentances with stop thing STOP Now I will never know the joy of
sending a telegram to someone STOP The worst part of all of it is that I
was going to send someone a telegram a while back STOP Instead I decided
the five or so dollars was too much STOP What a fool I was STOP
