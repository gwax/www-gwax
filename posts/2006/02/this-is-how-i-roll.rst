It may be well before my sailing season gets underway,
but I happened to be in a West Marine recently for other reasons and I
figured that I might as well grab myself this year's Eldridge Tide and
Pilot Book. I may not have any use for it now, but I will eventually and
it does a fantastic job of reminding me of sailing; oh man, boats.
