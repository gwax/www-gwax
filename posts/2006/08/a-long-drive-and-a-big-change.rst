Between the last post and last Tuesday, there hasn't been much to
report: I hung out a bunch, got sick a couple times and some other not
very noteworthy events. Since Tuesday, however, an awful lot has
happened: I've moved halfway across the country, become single and begun
preparations for the next big phase of my life, law school.

Since I'm going to law school in Minnesota (University of), it was
rather important to cut my commute down from the 22 hour drive from
Massachusetts to something more reasonable. The solution to my commuter
problems was to be found in moving to Minneapolis, MN and locating a
place of residence that is about 15-20 minutes walk to the law school.
This, of course, means that I had to drive out to Minneapolis, MN in my
dilapidated wreck of a Ford Explorer and I am happy to report that the
trip passed uneventfully. I didn't stop to do much in the way of
sightseeing along the way but I should like to note that, while passing
through Wisconsin, I was able to confirm that fresh `cheese
curds <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_curds>`__ are, in fact, all
that and a bag of chips, oh yes, certainly the bag of chips. Also, while
I'm on the topic, let me just put in a plug for the US Interstate
System; in Massachusetts, I hopped on I-90, which I was able to stay on
until Wisconsin, where I transferred to I-94, drove another hundred and
change miles and was at my destination. There is something very
convenient about being able to drive 1400ish miles at 75MPH in a fairly
straight line from point A to point B almost entirely on one road.

As to my unfortunate return to the land of the single, I consider the
matter to be one of necessary evils. Kristina and I broke up preceding
my departure for Minnesota because she didn't much want to be in a long
distane relationship and, to be frank, neither do I. Between how bad I
am about calling people to talk on the phone and how much a relationship
tends to depend on being in contact with someone, I would expect an
attempt at a long distance relationship to crash and burn horribly. As
far as I'm concerned, I like Kristina a bit much to want to let a
relationship with her crash and burn so, instead, I'm inclined to
believe that the best approach is to break up and then, perhaps, we'll
get back together at a more convenient time in the future. That,
however, is the future and is, as such, a matter to be concerned with
when the future becomes the present.

As for the law school phase of my life, I've got myself pretty much
fully moved into my new place and beyond that, I'll probably keep you
posted as new details emerge.
