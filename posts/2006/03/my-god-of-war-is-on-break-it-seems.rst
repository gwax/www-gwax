Whatever fantastic force I managed to drag out of myself on Monday was
not to be found today. My best guess is that by being aware of such a
feeling within me, I approached the evenings fencing looking for it and,
in so doing, didn't call it forth. In spite of failing to be *on* in the
way that I was on Monday, I wasn't particularly *off* and had a fine
time. Unfortunately, today I seem to have picked up more injuries than
any other day; meh, battle scars, oh well. I think that I'm going to
have to take a step back and see if I can't reapproach this mental issue
with a more naieve outlook on Friday.
