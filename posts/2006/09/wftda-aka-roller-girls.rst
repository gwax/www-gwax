In continuing to do fantastic things on Saturdays, last night I went to
see the Minnesota RollerGirls v. Tampa Tantrums roller derby. Prior to
yesterday, I had never heard of roller derbies but after last night, I'm
a complete convert. The sport works a bit like this: a bunch of girls on
rollerskates (the four-wheeled kind) skate around a track and each team
has one scoring girl (called the jammer) who gets a point for every time
she laps someone. The rest of the team tries to help their jammer get
around and prevent the opposing jammer from passing; now, when I say
"tries to help", I mean by blocking, checking and generally abusing the
other team. If you want a complete description of how things work check
out the `WFTDA home page <http://www.wftda.com/>`__ but, basically, it's
girls on rollerskates beating the crap out of each other. Seriously,
roller derbies are the best spectator sport ever created.

The sport is getting pretty popular in the US and there are teams all
over the country so those of you out there that know what's good for you
will go watch your local team compete. Apparently the #1 ranked team in
the US is the Austin Texecutioners so, Riad, it really behooves you to
go see a match.
