This morning I woke up early to join some 3Ls in hitting up a costume
shoppe and going to the Minnesota Renaissance Faire. I should note that
the costumes we were looking for were not D&D geek style tights, we were
looking for giant foam cowboy hats. We proceeded to spend the day
wandering around the Faire dressed as caricatures of cowboys, being
heckled and getting funny looks. We attended a couple of comedy shows
and ended up being the butt of the vast majority of the audience
targeted jokes. Basically, we were wandering around making fun of
everyone solely by our garb and being given a hard time for it. I am not
normally the type for Renaissance Faires but taking this approach really
made it a fantastic way to spend a Saturday; I highly recommend it.
