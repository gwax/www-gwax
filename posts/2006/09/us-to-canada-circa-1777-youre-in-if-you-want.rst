In reading the `Articles of
Confederation <http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/articles.html>`__
for my Constitutional Law class, I came across an interesting little
tidbit in Article XI, which reads as follows:

    *Article XI.*  Canada acceding to this confederation, and adjoining
    in the measures of the United States, shall be admitted into, and
    entitled to all the advantages of this Union; but no other colony
    shall be admitted into the same, unless such admission be agreed to
    by nine States.

Basically the United States was explicitly saying that United States
would accept Canada as a new state if Canada wanted to join the United
States. This in and of itself is kind of cute but added to another
thought experiment it becomes even more amusing. In my Constitutional
Law class we have been discussing whether or not the Constitution was
validly adopted based on the matter that the means in which it was
adopted were in violation of the, then in effect, Articles of
Confederation. If the Constitution were to have been illegally adopted
then it would follow that the Articles of Confederation are still valid
to this day. Between all these facts we have the situation that it could
be argued, with some validity, that Canada has the right to join the
United States to this day and that all Canada would need to do would be
to say they wanted in.
