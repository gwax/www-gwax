*YOU ARE 28 UNITED STATES CODE SECTION 1332!*

You are not a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure at all: you're the statute
that allows the federal district courts to hear diversity of citizenship
actions! You were drafted with the idea that an out-of-state party may
be unduly prejudiced by appearing in a foreign state. Sometimes people
may think that you're strange, and they try to minimalize your effects
by requiring an amount in controversy and by being especially strict on
the requirements for diversity. Also, attorneys often use you for "forum
shopping" and other undesirable behavior. But there's no getting around
the fact that you're so darned lovable! Your delightful quirkiness
entertains friends and law professors alike, and although others may
grumble about your eccentricities behind your back, they're always
talking about you, so you must be doing something right. Let's face it,
the world could use a few more 28 USC 1332's!
