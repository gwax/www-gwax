I have been thinking on the matter of what to name my new server quite a
bit lately and have found it to be the most difficult parts of setting
up my new computer. I believe, however, that I have finally settled on a
name. The list of runner-ups is as follows (in no particular order):

-  abyss
-  hobozero
-  tacosquid
-  cephalopod
-  sackfist
-  monkeyglove
-  gluttonous-slim
-  tzar-king-rex
-  hobo-overload
-  ralph
-  pants
-  el-boot
-  your-mom
-  nothing
-  e-hobo
-  thor-the-bumhammer
-  leonard
-  spatula

In the end, all of these possible names have lost out to *hobosphere*.
All glory be unto the hobosphere.
