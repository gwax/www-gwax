About a week ago, I undertook the project of cataloguing my Magic: The
Gathering card collection and I finally finished earlier today. I am
using a program called `Magic Suitcase <http://www.magicsuitcase.org/>`__
to do my cataloguing. The goal is to improve improve my awareness of what
cards I have and my ability to construct decks. Having completed my
cataloguing endeavor, I am now able to use the application to get
statistical information on my collection. Following is a spattering
of information about my collection:
