I went to see V for Vendetta with some folks earlier tonight and I came
away with one pedantic criticism and a simple analysis:

*Pedantic Criticism:* In the fight scene, near the end, when everything
else is running in slow-motion, the blood spurting out of people is
spurting at regular speed.

*Analysis:* Yeah, I've read 1984 already.
