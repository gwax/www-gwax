It has come to my attention
that the endangered Tree Octopus of the Pacific Northwest is suffering
through even tougher times than it has in the past and I have decided to
join the effort to preserve this unique species. Normally, I'm too lazy
to bother being proactive in regards to the environment but things have
gone too far with regards to the Tree Octopus. Admittedly, I'm quite a
fan of cephalopods but nonetheless, we are doing a very poor job as
dominant species here; we have a responsibility to the environment and
we cannot allow such a unique and important creature to go extinct.

For more information on organized attempts to preserve the Pacific
Northwest Tree Octopus, see the `official preservation
site <http://zapatopi.net/treeoctopus/>`__. For more general cephalopod
information, I recommend this `blog devoted to cephalopods <http://squid.us/>`__.
