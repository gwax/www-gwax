Another year has slipped by and I am now 23. The matter is really kind
of a non-event for me; my age increments by one and... what? I guess I
can take some solace in the fact that my age is now a Discordian holy
number (or maybe it's a holey number) but beyond that, there's really
nothing special about it.
