I remember, time was, you bought a computer game, popped the CD in,
copied the executables over and then played the game. All the data
stayed on the CD and you didn't use up your whole hard drive. These
days, every game demands that you install the complete contents of the
CD/DVD to your hard drive and it pisses me off. It's not like it needs
to be copied to the hard drive, I've seen the very same games run on
consoles without hard drives to install to and my computer has a faster
DVD drive than most consoles. It just annoys me to have the number of
games I can play at a given time limited by the fact that they all
demand to exist on a CD/DVD and my computer, especially considering they
all demand that you have the CD/DVD in the drive while you play the
game.
