Silly Nintendo

Just this morning, I was thinking about Nintendo's upcoming video game
console, codename Revolution. At the time I was thinking about how
fantastic a marketing and hype-building job Nintendo has been doing. The
end line of my thinking was the only thing that Nintendo could do wrong
at this point is choose a bad release name for the console and they've
done just that; they've decided to call it the `Nintendo
Wii <http://revolution.nintendo.com/>`__ (pronounced like "we"). Now,
certainly part of my dislike for the new name is based on having
considered it the Revolution for so long and having a general repugnance
for the practice of name changing (that's a whole other discussion in
and of itself); I expect that I won't dislike "Wii" as much when I get
used to it. That said, "Wii" is a terrible name for the US market;
"Xbox" and "PlayStation" aren't great either but at least they can be
pronounced without ambiguity and have some recognizable traits. In
Nintendo's defense, I think they've got "Revolution" planted firmly in a
lot of heads so people are going to buy it regardless of the name and
call it what they feel like; heck, I might just call mine a "Nintendo".
