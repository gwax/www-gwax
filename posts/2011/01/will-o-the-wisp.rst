Continuing `my earlier work <link://slug/ironhide>`__
in the realm of mixology, I would like to present my second cocktail
invention. The invention of this cocktail is the result of playing
around with gin,
`Chartreuse <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartreuse_%28liqueur%29>`__,
`St. Germain <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Germain_%28liqueur%29>`__, and
various other liqueurs in an attempt to make something tasty. This
cocktail earns its name, Will O' The Wisp, from its faint, ghostly,
green color.

Ingredients
-----------

-   3/4 oz Green Chartreuse
-   3/4 oz St. Germain
-   3/4 oz White Vermouth
-   1 dash Lavender Bitters
-   3 oz Dry Gin
-   1/4 oz Herbsaint or Absinth

Recipe
------

#.  Pour the Chartreuse, St. Germain, Vermouth, Bitters, and Gin into a
    cocktail shaker
#.  Pour the Herbsaint/Absinth into a chilled cocktail glass
#.  Swirl the cocktail glass, coating the sides, and pouring off any excess
    Herbsaint/Absinth
#.  Add ice to the cocktail shaker and shake
#.  Pour shaken cocktail into the prepared glass

Notes
-----

The Herbsaint/Absinth can be skipped, though I don't recommend it. The Lavender
Bitters are also optional but very highly recommended. I would recommend
stirring this cocktail (instead of shaking) as the resulting beverage has a
very different appearance.
