Here's a first for me: someone posted a "missed connection" about me on
Craigslist. One of my roommates randomly found it.

   I met you Saturday night at Bloodhound. We pet the awesome Saint
   Bernard and talked about mobile media. You're pretty cool, and I'm
   sorry we didn't get to talk more. Thanks for making my Saturday night
   :)
