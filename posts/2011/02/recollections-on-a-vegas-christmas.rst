It's been a bit over a month since my brother and I drove to Vegas to
spend Christmas weekend (plus a few days) with the rest of our family
(who flew out). I was being lazy but it seems that I'm `getting called
out <link://slug/sanfran-to-vegas-on-one-tank-or-exactly-why-i-love-my-car#comment-17666>`__
so here are my major recollections.

**The water :** The water in Vegas tastes terrible and is no good for
rinsing. I don't think that I've dealt with worse tap water in the US
before. I was quite happy to have refilled and brought my 5 gallon,
road-trip, water jug before leaving San Francisco.

**The drinking :** In Vegas, there is booze everywhere and you can drink
it anywhere on The Strip. Being able to wander from place to place while
carrying drinks is quite convenient; I really enjoy partaking of public
activities while carrying a drink or, to put it better, it's nice to
have drinks without having to be cooped up in a bar. Then, of course, on
top of the ability to wander with booze is how very easy it is to get an
awful lot of the stuff: free drinks while gambling, drink specials all
over the place, cheap convenience stores just across the street.

**The hangover :** Vegas leads to an almost perpetual state of hangover.
I wasn't drinking enough to get a particularly bad hangover but between
the drinking, the terrible water, and staying up late, I was definitely
a below 100% most of the trip. P.S. Worth it.

**The poker :** I should never play poker with people that aren't my
friends and I should never play poker where anyone expects me to drop
more than $20-$40. I lost about $100 in under an hour (maybe half that)
the first night we arrived. Fuck everything about Vegas poker.

**The craps :** Let me tell you about Christmas Day (parts of it at
least). Christmas stuff happened; Dave and I hung out with the rest of
the family; and we all went out for dinner at `Pampas
Churrascaria <http://www.pampasusa.com/>`__, which was phenomenally
good. After dinner, we all wandered The Strip for a bit, lost a little
money on a few things and then Dave and I split off from the rest of our
family to continue adventuring on our own.

I had been in contact with my friend Gautham, who happened to
concurrently be in Vegas, and we made plans to meet up later to play
craps. While Dave and I were waiting for Gautham to be ready to hang
out, we had a few more drinks, checked out the Vegas architecture (Luxor
is awesome; Aria is gorgeous; MGM is strangely green), and generally
wandered around. At some point, we grabbed ourselves a couple of Four
Lokos (so terrible but so awesome) from a convenience store and, shortly
thereafter, managed to properly get a hold of Gautham.

We met up with Gautham at the Aria and promptly decided that $25 was too
high a minimum for craps. Keep in mind that I had never played craps
before in my life. So we wandered over to the Bellagio to avail
ourselves of their $10 minimum tables. Understanding the basic principle
of craps (roll some dice, sevens are good opening rolls but bad
otherwise) I mostly took my guidance from Gautham at first and started
availing myself of free scotch & sodas. As I became slightly more
inebriated and started to get the hang of the game, things became
increasingly more entertaining. We had a pretty good table with some
pretty fun folks around but, most importantly, we had a really good
winning streak. At peak, I was probably up about $300-$400 and when we
eventually cashed out, I was up about $200 and a handful of drinks.

**The net :** Between my poker losses, slot machine losses (shiny things
are hard to resist), drink purchases, food purchases, roulette winnings,
roulette losses, and craps winnings, I ended up leaving Vegas slightly
(<$50) richer than when I arrived.

**The guns :** On our last full day in Vegas, Dave, Joe, our dad, and I
went out to shoot some guns. At first we went to `The Gun
Store <http://www.thegunstorelasvegas.com/>`__, which is advertised all
over the place, but the line was atrocious (well over an hour, possibly
two) so I fired up `Yelp <http://www.yelp.com>`__ and found out about
`Las Vegas Gun Range & Firearm
Center <http://www.lasvegasgunrange.net/>`__. We bailed on The Gun Store
and found that the line at Las Vegas Fun Range & Firearm Center was a
few minutes long.

I fired off a few clips from a 9mm pistol (don't recall the make or
model) and a couple clips from an H&K MP5. Man oh man, let me tell you,
the MP5 is a nice gun. Firing the MP5 fully automatic was kind of neat
but being zombie survival minded, I rather preferred switching it to
semi-automatic and going for accuracy.

**The company :** Vegas was awesome. Hanging out with Dave was awesome.
Hanging out with Gautham was awesome. Having dinners with my family was
nice. Going to the `Valley of
Fire <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_of_Fire_State_Park>`__ with my
family was neat. Hanging out with my family on the strip was not
particularly awesome.

I'm pretty sure that, going forward, I am going to view Vegas as a place
to go with friends but not family. I would say, if you're going to Vegas
with family, plan to do some stuff with them and plan to ditch them the
rest of the time.

**Return :** I'm probably going back with a bunch of `Fort
Awesome <http://fort-awesome.org/>`__ folks in April and I'm really
looking forward to the trip.
