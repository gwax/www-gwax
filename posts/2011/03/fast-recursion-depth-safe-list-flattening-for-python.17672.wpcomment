1.   That code isn't right -- unbalanced parens at least, and I don't see
     how it's supposed to work anyway (since "something" never changes, your
     "while hasattr(something...") loop will never end.
2.   list.insert is O(n), and you call it O(n) times, so your flatten is
     O(n^2)... ouch
