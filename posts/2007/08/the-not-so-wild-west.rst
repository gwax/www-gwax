I'm moving out to the not-so-wild-anymore American West. In a plan that's gone
from non-existent to fairly well developed in the past couple months, I'll be
leaving Massachusetts in early September to drive west. I'll be sharing the
road trip with my good friend Max and we're planning to head across the
northern part of the US. We'll be passing through Minneapolis, Yellowstone,
Glacier, Seattle, and some other spots, hopefully visiting folks along the
way. Ultimately, I'll be ending up in the Bay Area sometime in mid to late
September where I plan to stay for the indefinite future.

To all of you already out there, I'll see you soon and look forward to
hanging out again. to those of you still here in the East, I'm sorry to
be leaving again and I'll miss you. To those of you along the way, get
ready for George to come through town.
