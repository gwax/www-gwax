Rogue Smokey Blue cheese is like a block of sex. I recently found myself
in the cheese section of one of our fancier local grocers and found
myself buying cheese, as often happens to me in such situations. One of
the cheeses that I bought was Rogue Smokey Blue, which I chose because I
wanted a blue cheese and there was a sign claiming that this particular
one had won some award. Upon returning to my place of residence and
trying the various cheeses that I had obtained, I discovered that I had
chosen a real gem. So, if you're looking for a good blue cheese, I
highly recommend the Rogue Smokey Blue.
