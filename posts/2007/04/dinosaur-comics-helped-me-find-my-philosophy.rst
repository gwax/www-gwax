|Dinosaur Panpsychism Explanation| I was reading `Dinosaur
Comics <http://www.qwantz.com>`__, as it is consistently one of the best
comics on the Internet, and `T-Rex was explaining
panpsychism <http://www.qwantz.com/index.pl?comic=974>`__. Upon reading
the first panel (included on the right for copyright violation
purposes), I found myself thinking that
`panpsychism <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism>`__ sounded an
awful lot like my personal philosophy of the universe. Poking around
wikipedia a bit more, as one is oft want to do, I came across a few
other philosophical ideas. I don't quite accept panpsychism, preferring
the very similar hylopathism.

I feel safe describing my personal philosophy of the universe as
`hylopathism <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hylopathism>`__ with `weak
emergence <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_emergence>`__ and an
acceptance of the `pathetic
fallacy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathetic_fallacy>`__. Putting this
in simpler terms, I believe that everything in the universe, from the
smallest subatomic particle to the largest galaxy, is sentient, aware of
and experiencing existence in its own way (hylopathism). All sentience
and awareness within so-called higher beings emerges from and may be
reduced to the constituent sentience of lower beings (weak emergence). I
not only accept but revel in the attribution of human characteristics
and emotions onto the inanimate; a small part of me is saddened when a
rock is split in two because the atoms on the new surfaces have had
their friends torn from them (pathetic fallacy).

I feel that the extension of hylopathism with weak emergence is much the
same as strong panpsychism. The single mind that unites all things is
simply an emergent entity composed of its sub-entities. To get
existential for just a moment, we are all, one and the same within the
all-being but, at the same, each our separate individual selves; our
liver is at once the same entity as our heart and at the same a totally
separate entity. Have you ever considered the sentient nature of your
liver? How about the sentient nature of one of your brain cells? How
about the sentient nature of one of the hydrogen ions released into your
stomach acid? Hydrogen ions are very lonely creatures, a single proton
trying as hard as it can to find a friend to share electrons with
(loneliness is the pathetic fallacy sneaking in).

There you have it, I believe in hylopathism with weak emergence.
