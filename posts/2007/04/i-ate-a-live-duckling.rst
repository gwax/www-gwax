As I've noted a few times before, when I remember my dreams, they tend
to be quite vivid, if not lucid. My dream of Saturday night was no
different and it was odd enough that I still recall it and want to
mention it.

<dream>

    I found myself sitting in an eatery of sorts, enjoying breakfast,
    an omelet if I recall correctly. Part way through my meal, I noticed a
    fluffy thing in my mouth, pulled it out and figured it must have been a
    hair. After finishing my meal, my waitress came over apologizing
    profusely about something. Normally, a waitress apologizing as
    emphatically as she was without specifying why would probably frighten
    me but I wasn't very perturbed this time around. After calmly inquiring
    into what the problem was, I was informed that a whole live duckling had
    accidentally made its way into my food. The waitress continued
    apologizing and asked what she could do to make it up to me. I still
    wasn't terribly perturbed by the affair so I said that I'd take the cost
    of my meal as recompense and be done with the matter. It took a little
    bit of convincing the waitress that I really didn't mind very much and
    the cost of my meal was sufficient but then I went along my way. Shortly
    thereafter, I coughed and a whole bunch of soft, underdeveloped,
    duckling feathers came out. Some nearby children laughed at me but I
    shrugged it off. Then, I coughed again and out popped a whole live
    duckling. Now, let me tell you, coughing up a live duckling is a very
    bizarre experience.
