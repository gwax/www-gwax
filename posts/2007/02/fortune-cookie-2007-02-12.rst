    | All the water in the world can't sink a
    | ship unless it gets inside.
    | ---
    | Lucky Numbers 33, 4, 24, 5, 18, 44

Commentary: I do like boats and I do like it when they don't sink. That
said, I feel like there's a densely hidden metaphor here; are you trying
to say that I need to not let things get to me?
