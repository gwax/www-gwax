As some of you may be aware, today was Halloween and in my culture we dress up
on Halloween. We often dress as monsters, grotesques, clowns, heroes, other
phantasms and fantasies. In following with the theme that is prescribed by my
cultural understanding, I had but one logical option, I went as `Phineas
Gage <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage>`__. The strange tale of
Phineas Gage is a truly amazing one; as a railway foreman in 1848, a
tapping iron was shot through his skull, destroying a substantial
portion of his frontal lobe. Miraculously, Gage survived the hole in his
brain largely unchanged save for some personality alterations. It was a
fun costume to make and it got me more than a few comments and funny
looks on the BART to and from work today. I think that I'll try for
something even fancier next year.
