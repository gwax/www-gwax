Happy 50\ :sup:`th` birthday `Sputnik <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik>`__,
you flying `grapefruit <http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Sputnik>`__. Oh, and
thanks for all the space technology that you inspired out of Cold War fear.

I must say though, it would be nice if we were still into that whole
space program thing. It might also be cool if we didn't waste so much
money on unneeded and excessive military superiority. I guess somebody
forgot to tell us that the cold war ended sixteen years ago.
