Well, the year of our Lord 2006 has come to a close and with it another
chapter has been written in the annals of the world. Looking back on
2006, I'd say that it was a pretty good year, full of good times and
good people. 2006 was also a pretty big year for me in terms of life,
career and those sorts of things; I closed the book on professionally
becoming an engineer and undertook a new path that will eventually lead
to a legal career. I've changed localities, moving out to Minnesota for
the time being; I expect that I'll be back eventually but not until I
finish up law school and, besides, it's nice having a change of scenery
for a while. 2006 also marks the year that I brewed my first batch of
beer, marking the uptake of a new hobby that I hope to carry with me for
the rest of my days. All in all, 2006 had a few downs, mostly relating
to moving away from people, and quite a few ups, so I would say that
overall it was a pretty good year in the life of George.

As tends to be a subject around this time of year, let's talk about New
Year's resolutions, shall we? `Last year <link://slug/resolutions-2k6>`__ I
resolved to 1) get better at meeting and interacting with new people, and
2) be friendlier. In spite of forgetting about those resolutions pretty
quickly into the year, I'd say that I did a decent job of being
friendlier and a half-decent job of getting better at dealing with new
people. Now that a brief analysis of last year is out of the way, let's
dive into resolutions for this year:

-  Be more productive
-  Be more professional
-  Be more fiscally responsible
-  Get better at faking extroversion
-  Get better at faking an alpha type personality
-  Exercise
-  Eat healthier
-  Fence more
-  Play more video games

It's a bit of a hefty list this year but that's because there are
elements of my life that I've decided are long due for an overhaul.
Let's hope I can remember my resolutions this year or, failing that,
make good on them anyway.
